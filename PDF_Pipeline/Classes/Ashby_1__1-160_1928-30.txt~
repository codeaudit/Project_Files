The argument. That all thought consists of the action of 
nerve cells, that nerve cells consist of or contain
"unit ideas", and that all thought consists in the linking 
of many nerve cells, thus producing a "chain of thought."
This probably starts as a sensory stimulus and finishes 
as a motor response. Note that the motor response may 
be long delayed, as when I receive a letter, and sit
down, motionless in a chain, and after few minutes
complete (motor) inactivity, rise to reply to it. Note 
that the muscular energy of the response need not
have any necessary relation to the importance of the 
train of thought. This suggests that the current 
travels along a single set of fibres, no matter
how serious the matter on hand, and will be 
adequately discharged if it is allowed to fire off a
solitary Betz cell. Or it may, if great effort be 
called for, stimulate a cell which will pass on
the same stimulus to many dendrites (thus
actually greatly increasing the energy now present)
and those dendrites may each stimulate a Betz cell, thus 
the same energy of the original impulse may fire off 
one or a great number of Betz cells and their muscles.
We see how this may spread in (?) convulsions

or there may be more than one amplifying cell, arranged
in series, thus: - 


Fig. 2 (hand-drawn diagram)


Note. I am assuming continuously that the impulses
are physical electrical waves. Note that the impulse
cannot be an electric current otherwise it would take 
no time to move along a nerve. The electrons would 
move "en bloc". It is a wave.


My theory provides a very nice mechanism and 
explanation for dreams. Dreams consist of just
those impulses of the previous day that have 
been dammed up and are allowed to proceed further*.
Now dreams are pretty complicated things.


*Note. Can a wave be help up? And how?

A dream may contain several different interpretations.
Now to try and invent a dream, shortly and simply, that 
would contain all the masses of material that a dream 
does contain would be an exceedingly difficult job 
for even a highly intelligent man. But the dream
appears rapidly, easily, fluently, - it never gets 
stick and can't see how to get on, it just pours
forth. I suggest that it is because the varying 
dammed up forces are pushing on, and the dream
thoughts follow because, by virtue of their pressure 
they will tend to follow certain paths, and to act
on one another, and on other forces in the brain-mind
in a purely physical manner. It is analogous to 
my idea of not being able to understand how
on earth the steam in an engine knew that 
it had to leave the boiler to go down a 
long maze of piping to the cylinder. I now
see clearly that it just pushes, and its environment 
does the rest, so to speak. So it is with dreams.
The impulses are pushing on to motor action 
and in their wanderings they pass through and
stimulate various cells and that constitutes the 
dream.

With regard to the removal of cortex. Why 
doe sit not produce a gap in the person's mind?
At present I cannot say. It is an important
consideration.


-


On the nature of the "unit ideas". Jung has pointed out 
(Psychology of the Unconscious) Ref. (1) how closely consciousness 
and words are associated. I personally always think,
when thinking consciously and logically, in words. I 
explain the matter and discuss it, in words with myself.
This suggests that words are the unit ideas. On the 
other hand, the unconscious seems to deal with
much more vague terms.


-


I look at the clock. A picture of it is projected onto 
the occipital visual cortex. It is then synthesized 
and I know it to be a clock i.e. the corneal retinal 
cells synthesize their collective impressions and connect
up with the word "clock", and indirectly, with its
associations, although that particular collection of 
cells may never before have been stimulated in 
that particular way. i.e. in sight, there is an 
integrating, synthesing mechanism at work.

I have reason to believe that the nerve cells are
somewhat self governing, i.e. the cell, on receiving 
an impulse, can decide to which cell it is going to 
pass on the impulse. This may be queried, no more
that a nerve cell is on a pan with Paramecium and what 
Paramecium can do the nerve cell can probably do.
This will serve as a useful criteria in future when I
introduce hypothetical functions of nerve cells.


-


Note. (Bainbridge and Hayes - p. 43) Ref. (2) The law of forward
direction. A neuron will conduct 
impuses in one direction, and one direction only. It will
pass across a synapse in one direction and one direction
only. Later note: This is not necessarily true. Is is merely a (?)
from definite motor and sensory nerve.


This seems to conflict with association. Two ideas
may be very closely associated. I associate "cat" and
"dog". Either word will call up the other, or rather,
it may... Association is not so simple as it 
seems. This might be explained thus:


Fig. 3 (hand-drawn diagram)


This is impossible as the middle synapse would 
have to conduct both ways. But this (Fig. 4)


(12 of 250)


6.


may be possible: - 


Fig 4. (hand-drawn diagram)


i.e. The right hand synapse would be used for 
cat -> dog, while the left hand one would 
give dog -> cat. Note. Here there 
would be a strong tendency for a circus movement
to start. There may be several reasons why it 
does not. This circus movement can only (?) occasionally : -


A portion of a nerve is refractory (inevitable for 
0.0025 sec = 2.5 x 10^-3 sec. after the passage of an
impulse.


An impulse is conveyed along a nerve at 
120 metres per second = 1.2 x 10^4 cm./sec.


Therefore In .0025 sec at 1.2 x 10^4 cm/sec, impulse will move 
forward through 30 c.m. Therefore impulse will be followed
by 30 cm of refractory nerve. Therefore any circle less
than 30 cm in circumference cannot produce a 
circus movement.


Nerve fibres (axons) are non fatigable.
p. 53 The law of forward direction is not at all universally
true, therefore I need not bother any further about it.


(13 of 250)


7. 


An impulse may terminate as an inhibition (e.g. Pyramidal tract + trace jerk)
Synapses (in the cases studied) showed a definite 
tendency to allow conduction in one direction only,
but it is not absolute.


An impulse may terminate in both stimulation
and inhibition (reciprocal unnervation, for instance) Fig 5.


An inhibition might almost be considered a 
motor response, (of a negative fluid)*


Fig 5. (hand-drawn diagram)


It must be taken for granted, and is obvious that one
cell may stimulate more than one other cell. i.e.
the impulse may be split up in parts and re-
distributed, each branch of the impulse being equal
to the original impulse.


More than one impulse may lead to the same
response. This is obvious. Fig 6.


Fig 6. (hand-drawn diagram)


*This is true both with nerves (pyramidal tract) and
psychologically. Of rabbit, actively doing nothing when 
a dog approaches. 


(14 of 250)

Each time a reflex occurs, it leaves the 
synapses more easily passed (after initial fatique).
This is the basis of habit.


Some reflexes : - When a stimulus arrives, it 
may provoke not one response but a whole 
series of responses which go on after the original
stimulus has ceased. (e.g. scratch reflex).


Therefore nerve cells are able to originate impulses 
of their own accord, when "told to do so" (by the 
original impulse). (Other examples, breathing
stimulation of medulla, steady stream of impulses 
from pyramid tracts (?)). Fig 7.


Fig. 7 (hand-drawn diagram)


Note. This originating of impulses may be a bit 
doubtful.

Animals with cerebral hemispheres removed seem

normal. Does (?) consist of many levels, lowest
being reflex action (knee jerk) and highest - well - 
intellectually?, each layer controlling to some 
degree the layer below it? It seems possible.
Thus: - the knee jerk is independant but is
modified by higher impulses. Somewhat like
the heart which beats of its own accord but 
can be quickened or slowed by other impulses.
We know that the sen-instinct continually pushes 
forward - but that the higher powers in the 
mind may partially control it.


-


The fact that (?)-sensory etc areas exist 
suggests that there is much intercommuniucation
among the members of this group (because cells are
all close together) and that after the intercommunication,
the impulse is then passed on and sent elsewhere. Cf
bottom of p.4.


-


The higher functions may be able to work by 
comparing one sent of stimuli with another.

Note word blindness and word deafness. These must

In them, words may be perfectly seen or heard,
but they convey no meaning, similar to the 
person who reads or hears a foreign language.
In other words the reception is manual but the 
associations are broken.

Nerve cells from (amoeba) to man gradually
and steadily increasing comlexity in braches. i.e.

Associations bend the (?) one way until 
extperience has taught them vice versa.
i.e. I know that gall stones cause jaundice but 
have only just learnt that jaundice may be caused
by gall stones. Note that this refers to book learning.
Jaundice is merely a dependant association on 
gall stones. Gall stones here is the independant, 
jaundice the dependant association, and the 
impulse (association) can only go one way (until
I have learnt to think the other way as well.


(17 of 250)


11.


But note that if, in clinical experience, I come across
jaundice and gall stones together, with neither emphasised
more than the other, then they are independantly 
associated and either will call up a memory of the other.


-


The time taken for an impulse to traverse a 
synapse depends on the strength of the 
stimulus. With powerful stimuli, the time taken to 
cross the synapses (in a reflex one) is almost nil,
but with weak stimuli, the time is very markedly
increased.


Note. Is this a pure synapse action or does a third 
neuron enter? If (?) be thus : - the powerful
stimulus (?) to another neuron which by 
acting, lowers the (?) of the synapses, thus: -


Fig 9. (hand-drawn diagram)


-

12.


-




Note to p.H. middle section - On the other hand I have 
experience of "ideas" that are quite wordless and 
formless. i.e. on waking up I often
have an "impression" of what I have dreamt
without any idea of what it actually was. Note 
that this is partially because it has been pushed 
into the unconcious, but a sort of "echo"
seems to remain.


-


This question of how the nerve cells 
direct their own impulses is difficult to
accept and difficult to explain.


We know this point - that a single
stimulus, such as a tap on the (?) patella
produces only one (?). The complicated 
responses only come as a result of complicated
stimuli. This must be so, for how can 
a "unit" stimulus possibly produce different 
results? The whole law of cause and effect would
be broken. (Assuming that the organism 
remains the same, for, of course, the same


(19 of 250)


13. 


stimulus applied after a lapse of time may have 
quite a different effect, owing to the fact that 
the organism has had the same (?) and modifying 
experience in between.).


Therefore we much introduce a new idea,
not of one solitary wave travelling through 
the brain, but of a multitude of integrated
stimuli, all mutually affecting each other,
travelling through the brain in a bunch, as it 
were.


Note the way in which, If I hear the 
word "wa" pronounced, I do not know if it 
means "way" or "weigh", but when I hear the 
content I know at once.


Similarly, if I hear the note (a drawing of a 'c')
played, I cannot say from which tune it comes,
but, as soon as I hear the content, I know
it and recognize it.


Thus, different impulses are integrated, not only
in recognizing an object, where they are 
simultaneous, and where they 
act as a "bunch," but they are also 
integrated in time, so that what follows it 
integrated with what is past.

Note from "Freud's theories of the Neuroses," by Hirschmann (Ref. (3)).


The dream shows these mechanisms : - 


(1) Condensation 
(2) Displacement
(3) Dramatisation
(4) Secondary elaboration
(5) Symbolism
(6) Inversion
(7) Censor activity


Cf p.2. How does our theory explain these?


Firstly repression. Stimulated cell tries to cause activity 
but is inhibited by another cell, which has been 
caused to act by the same stimulus --


Fig 10. (hand-drawn diagram)


"repressing" cell blocking path of synapse.
and forcing impulse to travel along another path.


-


I have a very strong impression that there is what we
may call a "through" mechanism. i.e. every stimulus
sends an impulse up the sensory nerves, to brain, there
it is redirected and then goes to muscular action.




(21 of 250)


15.


Fig 11. (hand-drawn diagram)


i.e. all impuslses start as sensory impulses and all must 
eventually go through to muscular or other action. We note that 
inhibited impulses, or "wishes," tend always to burst through 
into action, or they burst through in dreams.


Therefore it is a fundamental propertt of brain and of 
mind that all action starts as a sensory stimulus, 
and all sensory stimuli tend ultimately to end in 
action. (Note that inhibition is a form of action).


-


Note on the drumming-up of impulses. This undoubtedly
can happen (see delayed response). Freud's repressed
complexes prove this.


-


Note on mental energy. (Cf botton part of p.1).
While it is true that the brain as a whole obeys the 
law of conservation of energy, yet when we are 
considering purely the energy in nerve fibres, this
no longer holds for energy, in the form of glucose 
etc can pass into them. Thus there can be 
no principle of the conservation, or equality, of energy 
when applied to thought and nerve impulses. The


(22 of 250)


16.


impulse may amplify itself or decrease as the occasion 
demands.


(Note. Can it decrease? We see by the laws of 
"through" mechanism that every cell once stimulated
must ultimately push its way through to action. If an
umpulse can decrease, it must either decrease by 
(?) off part of its energy by action (as when we 
sigh with relief after getting worked up) or it may 
be able to decrease thus: - 


Fig 12 (hand-drawn diagram)


Three trains of impulses decreasing to one impulse.


I rather suspect that one cell impulse 
= a constant amoung energy.


- 


The amount of energy acquired by a stimulus which 
is progressing to action largely depends on whether it touches
on one of the basic instincts. i.e. a stimulus which touches 
on the sex instinct will call up for more energy than a 
more trivial stimulus (Cf the fanaticism of the various 


(23 of 250)


17.


actions when Freud, or (?) abnormality is (?)
to the average person (but repression comes into this a 
bit, but in time).


-


The "through" mechanism suggests that in melancholia
the stimuli are not going through. There is no 
actual anaesthesia so that the block must be further 
on. Is it due to a steady increase in the 
resistance of the synapses? With mania due to a 
steady decrease? Or is it due to a block at one
part? Or is it due to a loss of energy production
of the great instincts?


Note from Price. (1922). p. 1601 Ref(4) Melancholia ".......The
sensitiveness of the stain appears to be diminished, and definite
areas of anaesthesia and analgesia of the so-called functional
distribution have been described. .....refleces
are usually sluggish.....(p. 1602)....koenaesthesia
may be so diministed that the patient feels as tho 
some part of his body were last or converted into 
some lifeless material, or indeed that he is wholly
dead........ Anaesthesia and analgesia are 
usually present, or at any rate no expression of 
feeling can be excited by the application


(24 of 250)


18.


of a painful or other stimulus."


(Mania) ".....Ideas seem to arise and pass through his 
mind with extraordinary celerity....ideas...follow
the line of automatic asssociation. 


_


Note that some of the opposite tendencies of mind such 
as introversion and extroversion, stability and instability,
etc may perhaps be considered as and + or - of the 
same things, such as version and stability. 


-


(?) tension can produce a violent feeling of lack of 
confidence and complete viability to cope with things. Also a 
feeling of strangeness, awkwardness and shyness.


- 


Day dreaming wastes a tremendous amoung of energy. Note
that day and night dreams are capable of getting rid of 
a certain amount of energy dammed back.


-


The concios mind can merely momentarily deflect our 
actions. The longer they are held off the insinctive 
path, the harder the effort to hold them off.


(25 of 250)


19.


This is obviously connnected with the "through mechanism".
I shall, in future, call this "the principle of 
'perviations'".


Note that some outlets are sufficient in "quality"
to allow perviation, othernot right in "quality."
This corresponds to the difficulty or easy of sublimation
etc with different impulses and outlets.


Therefore the amount of energy which can be 
perviated through an outlet, is a 
function of the qualities of the outles, and of the 
qualities of the perviating impulse.


-


Mental pain is directly proportional to the degree
of conflict.


Amount of conflict between two instincts depends 
on (a) Environment and what one is taught
   (b) Neuroses in strength of the instincts
   (c) Stimulation of each
   (d) opportunities for sublimation (allows a 
        "sideways" leakage of energy.).

Note on amount of mental energy. I have long 
held the view that epilepsy is due to excess of 
energy, which periodically bursts forth. Note that 
Grandpa's father was epileptic. Grandpa when 
middle aged went insane twice. Now that he 
is old (about 75), he is much more stable but 
still has energy much above the average.


I have noticed that when I have a large 
amount of new energy, I am in a precarious
position mentally. When I have little I am 
more cow-like.


I am rather suspecting that it is not lack of 
energy that causes insanity, but excess. If I 
were judging solely from my experience of myself
I  should say unhesitantingly that it was excess that
caused the trouble.


Note that getting up late and going to bed late is 
a sign of tension (clinical experience). I noted 
that when I have had a lot of worry or tension 
I always feel easier and better in the evening (when I 
am more tired).

Introversion is the essential feature of "attacks

The proper adaptation to life consists of an

Is the great trouble of this world fundamentally 
the difficulty of making decisions? Note that
a decision where all the pros and cons are 
one way is a very easy decision to make.


(28 of 250)


22. 


But in practise, decisions are seldom as simple
as this. Consequently, every time one has to make 
a decision there is a certain amount of
conflict. THe stronger the energies of the pros and 
cons - the more the conflict, and therefore the more 
difficulty in making the decision.

Note that there are two types of minds - those 
in whom a thought may have very great emotion attached
to it, and those in whom a thought has nil. Such
people as the latter can tack with (?) calmness
to anyone about (?) and the thoughts have no 
emotion. The former (myself) cannot, as the 
thought has almost as much, or more emotion
than the action.

Preliminary forumula for conflict :- 


Degree of conflict is proportional to meanness of the powers
of the opposing forces. It is proportional to the 
continued stengths of the two forces. 


There are two obvious formulae to try : - 


F(1) = larger force; F(2) = smaller force; C = Conflict 


(29 of 250)


23.


    F(1) x F(2)
C = ___________   . . . . . . . . . . . . . (1)


    F(1) - F(2)








    F(1) + F(2)
C = ___________   . . . . . . . . . . . . . (2)


    F(1) - F(2)










(2) fails thus: put F(2) = 0




C = F(1) + 0 
    _________


    F(1) - 0




  = F(1)
    F(1)




  = 1 (unit of conflict)




This would suggest that a certain amount of 
conflict was always necessary. This is almost 
certainly not so.

Does dreaming etc. get rid of inhibited stimuli action?
Note that a repressed complex may go on for years without 
losing any of its original power. This suggests that it 
does not. But note - a person with a complex is 
continually receiving more stimuli even when quite 
away from the actual object. Obviously it would 
burst if it lost some of its inhibited stimuli. Therefore
obviously there is a steady leak, sufficient to 
balance the bursting force. When the stimuli 
are nil, the complex will leak away to nothing.
When stimuli start to arrive again, at first
the pressure will rise rapidly as there is no 
pressure to force a leakage. Then as the pressure
rises higher and higher the complex will leak 
more and more rapidly, and will ultimately
re-establish a new balance at a higher level.


Rate of leak is proportional to pressure.

i.e. For any given value of F(1), C will always be a 
maximum when F(2) = F(1) as the maximum goes up 
along the line F(1) = F(2).


Tiny differences between F(1) and F(2) will not make the 
vast differences that they will in eq. (1).  


As F(1) and F(2) get bigger and bigger together so the 
conflict rises.


With F, constant, at first when F(2) = 0 there will 
be no conflict. C=O. As F(2) approaches 
F(1) C will rise to a maximum, and then as F(2) 
passes F(1), the conflict will fall again to 0.
With equation (1) the conflict becomes negative unless
we suddenly change F(1) and F(2).


The maxmimum conflict occurs when F(1) = max
= F(2), We are then at the height of conflict.


Note that with (3) and (4) p.24, with F(1) = F(2),
ease of action = 0, difficulty of action = infinity. 
At this point action would be impossible. But
even with the worst conflict some action is possible.
Oh, but one minute! When F(1) = F(2) action, on 
that particular line of conduct is almost if not 
quite impossible. But at the same time 
conflict almost certainly does not = infinity.

Now it is found that if a person is born with a reasonable
brain, he invariably finds it quite easy to 
function efficiently (excluding acquired complexes etc). 
The only people who cannot function efficiently are 
the mental defectives - people who obviously have 
not got a good instrument to start with. Now
if efficient functioning were a frightfully tricky
affair, and very complicated, then one would 
meet clinically with lots of people who had good
brains anatomically, but who, just because
there was one little bit gone wrong, would not 
be able to behave efficiently. If, for instance,
various cells had different functions, and 
all the dendrils in the brain had to join up 
exactly so, then one would expect to find lots 
of people who couldn't quite do it. But one 
does not. This suggests that the brain 
develops with just reasonable accuracy, and that the 
nerves do not have to perform frightfully 
complicated reactions, but that there is some 
simple principle, which is easy for the nerves
to follow, and which inevitably leads to the 
right reaction. Such a principle might be 
for instance, that each cell passes its


(35 of 250)


29. 


impulse on to that cell with which it is 
connected which is at its lowest electrical potential.
It would then have to be shown that such
a principle would, after practise, lead quite 
automatically to efficient functioning.


Of course there are many such possible
principles to choose from. It may be 
electrical, chemical, physical, anatomical,
or a membrane (synapse) functional.


Here are some possible hypotheses: - 


(a) Every cell passes on its impulse to that cell
with which it is in immediate connection which 
is at lowest, or highest potential, on the 
synapse which offers least resistance. (This is 
probably true of any theory.) It may pass its
impulse only to one cell or it may distribute
its impulse proportionately to the other cells 
according to the resistance of the synapse. But 
(law of all or nothing) this would result in 
a complete distribution of full impulses, i.e.(?)


(b) Each stimulus may tend to go geographically 
straight at the synapses. It would curve 
round with a cell. As though it had momentum. This would explain the


(36 of 250)


30.


complicated anatomy of the brain.


(c) At birth the cells may be all joined up and 
education may be result of slowing down 
those paths which are not needed, the synapses 
having a steady tendency to lecture impermeable.
This would explain the steady viability to learn 
in old age. Note, the child when pricked 
moves all its limbs, eyes, etc. When older it 
merely performs the appropriate movement. The
passage of an impulse would tend to keep it open.
This would mean that a path laid down in 
childhood would become more and more 
emphasised. This is an inversion of the popular
idea which speaks of learning as an "opening up" 
of new paths.


This would also explain why the child after
six months (when it is really beginning to learn)
has practically an adult brain. If it were
a question of opening up new paths, then it would 
be sufficient for the child's brain to grow steadily
as it acquired new reactions. (Note. This might 
also be explained by the theory that a child's
intellectual learning is only a minute part of its 
mental equipment, and that by the age of five,




(37 of 250)


31. 


having learnt language, how to balance and
move efficiently etc, it has learnt 95% 
of what it has to know, and that subsequent 
school knowledge is merely adding on another 
1 or 2% to its knowledge).


-


Note. Since we are out to discover what learning 
is and how it is done, we must avoid carefully 
all such expressions as "the child would
then learn" etc, because we do not 
know what learning is, and we must not 
presuppose that there is any such entity 
as "the child" which is learning. It is 
the body which is learning. It must be 
noted that we have to make a choice
here (and a very fundamental and important 
choice) between two theories -


(a) That at birth, there is merely a 
body which learns to react and 
which grows up, and that the individual
is just a bundle of reactions, or


(b) That at birth there is a body,
inhabited by a higher being, 
who sits in the brain, and has to


(38 of 250)


32. 


learn to recognise the impulses as they 
are received and who has to learn which 
of the cells must be stimulated to
produce a given result.


The difference between these two theories may 
be compared to a railway. Are the 
points, signals etc. connected up and self
governing, or is there a signalman in 
the box who is ignorant at first of what 
all the levers and indicators are, but who,
by pulling first one and then another lever,
and noticing the results, gradually learns 
what they do and then finally becomes 
thoroughly practised until he can run 
the whole show perfectly efficiently?


The first theory is obviously behaviorist,
the second is animist. 


Now, to try to work out these two 
theories on a scientific basis is quite different.
Science hunts for laws, and can only
succeed where there are laws. The laws 
in the first case are probably straightforward.
The laws in the second case will be the
laws of psychology of the soul. The first


(39 of 250)


33.


subject is probably within our grasp. The 
second introduces so many complications 
at once that it is probably hopeless to attempt
at present.


Therefore we will provisionally adopt the 
first point of view, and must therefore 
rigorously avoid such expressions as: - 


"The child will thus learn...."


as suggesting a higher being (the Child) who
uses the nerves to learn by. The expression
in future must be - 


"The body will thus react in the 
future...."


"The effect of the past paths laid down,
on this stimulus will be...."


In other words the body must be viewed 
utterly as a machine, without rhyme or 
reason, which in virtue of its original
makeup, reacts efficiently.


Now, why does this machine react efficiently 
though blindly?


__


(40 of 250) 


34. 


To start at the beginning -
the body is born, cold air strikes it, and 
it cries. This is our first primary reaction.
How does it work? A few minutes later it 
is fed and it sucks? How is this arranged?
It seems to me that the reactions can be 
divided into two fundamentally different
types - innate and acquired. This corresponds 
rather with Pavlov's division of reflexes into innate
and conditioned Ref. (5). The chick as soon as it is 
out of the egg stands upright and walks. It 
does so at once without any practising. Obviously
the animal must have all the necessary paths 
laid down at birth. This means that 
the neurones for that function knew how to 
develop and did so. This brings these reactions 
into line with any other fact of development, 
just as the arteries know how to develop to 
form the Circle of Willis.


We will therefore provisionally assume that 
the crying, sucking, (?), digesting,
breathing etc. activities of the new born child
are inborn by the configuration of certain 
tracts and that these tracts develop correctly in 


(41 of 250)


35. 


utero, in just the same manner as, say,
the muscles and ligaments and bones which grow 
correctly in utero. Why these latter grow 
correctly is not our problem but is left for 
the cytologists or embryologists. They need
not therefore concern us further.


The fact that the child cannot walk at 
birth, which the chick can, is strictly in 
line with the theory that in the chick the 
tracts are laid down at birth, and probably
always remain automatic, while in the 
child, the act of walking does not come 
under the "developmental" or "embryological"
mechanism, but is left to be 
acquired as a "higher" art; thus exemplifying
the general observation that in man (?)
of the lower functions degenerate as such 
and are worked by means of "higher" 
mechanisms. (Compare decay of functions 
of the corpus striatum in man etc. These 
functions are largely taken over by the 
cortex). In the new born child, of course,
the higher functions are not yet working.

Note, it may not be cells that identify particular

___


The impulses, instead of being unit impulses which 
travel up the nerve and then through the synapse, 
may be oscillating currents like wireless, which
travel through synapses by capacity, and
which can be blocked at one synapse and passed 
at another, because they have different 
capacities. The idea was given me by the 
fact that two feelings are often very similar
although logically quite different, in rather the 
same way as the notes of an octave are 
similar. In this case an impulse would 
oscillate all through the nervous system, being 
directed by the different capacities of the synapses.
? does the pyramidal system cross over, like 
telegraph wires, in order to avoid induction?


____


On reading (?) Ref.(6) re alternating currents, he says 
that reflection of alternating currents takes place 
at any change of the nature of the conduction, i.e.


(43 of 250)


37. 


change in resistance, in inductance etc.Now along
the nerve axons, conditions are pretty uniform, but at 
the cells there are great chances for reflection.
Note that the afferent neurons are shaped in a way 
which will avoid reflection : - 


Fig 14. (hand-drawn diagram)


While the efferent, pyramidal cells would give 
much reflection : - 


Fig 15. (hand-drawn diagram)


The impulse comes down the 
dendron, presumably, and then has to hit the lower wall.
Part goes on down the axon, while other parts are 
reflected off, ? for integrative purposes? This theory
at least gives some explanation of the hitherto 
quite unexplained, but constant difference between 
the afferent and efferent cells!

The brain, having performed an action in response to 
a stimulus, must be then informed as to whether or 
not the reaction was appropriate, otherwise it (the 
brain) can never learn. The child, who grips a 
red hot poker instead of letting it go (i.e. flexes fingers
instead of extending them) will next time do the 
opposite. Therefore we will conclude - a reaction 
to any given stimulus, if followed by "pain" (in
its broad sense) will next time do the opposite. We
have at first: - 


Stimulus -> reaction -> pain


Next time we have.


Stimulus -> opposite reaction ->


If the first time we have


Stimulus -> reaction -> pleasure


Then next time we will have


(45 of 250)


39.


Stimulus -> same reaction ->


Therefore we may say with some certainty that "pain
following a reaction reverses the "points" so that 
next time, the stimulus produces the opposite
reaction. Now the first reaction (child and poker)
consisted of excitation of flexation and inhibition of 
extension - this is changed to excitation of extension 
and inhibition of flexation. Between extension and 
flexation there exists therefore a sort of reciprocal 
arrangement, and pain reverses the process.


Assume there two waves of different frequencies 
of the afferent impulses of pleasure and pain. There are 
known to be pain spots which may be stimulated 
(a) by accidents (leading to coordination) and (b) by 
punishment (leading to conditioned reflexes of behaviour).
These two are probably really identical. The pleasure 
impulses we may leave at the moment as they are 
not as dramatic in their action on the organism as 
pain. (They do have a positive effect, however,
as is shown by Pavlov's dogs who were all conditioned
to pleasure (food) stimuli). Ref.(5) However - the
mechanisms of bodily reaction are coupled by 
reciprocal innervation and reciprocal excitation and 
inhibition. If a stimulus produces a reaction


(46 of 250)


40.


and this reaction is followed by pain, then the pain
stimulus goes up to the brain and reverses the 
previous arrangement. If now we subject the 
animal to the same stimulus again, the paths 
have been reversed and the animal will now do 
the opposite to its previous reaction - not 
exactly the opposite, but some fairly opposite
alternative, of which there are many. If this is 
followed by pain, a condition of strain is set
up, (the animal says "this is (?)
perplexing). This attitude of mind has its 
counterpart in the fact that the pain stimulus 
is now producing conflict. However, a new 
path is found and the points re-set. If this is now
satisfactory - well and good - the points remain
freed. If however it is unsatisfactory, even
more conflict and despair results. More and more
paths have been inhibited and it is becoming more 
and more difficult for the impulses to find a 
path to excitation. Ultimately complete inhibition 
sets in - as in the poor (?) who,
baffled at every turn to find a suitable means
of excitation, finally passes into a state of 
complete inhibition (katatonic stupor).

41.


Note. Very important. You wrote that, in discussing 
these mechanisms, I have been drawing equally 
freely upon the lowest of reflexes and the highest 
of psychological mechanisms quite indiscriminately
for my examples, and this is justified by the fact
that they both fit the case quite well.
This is similar to the principle of relativity
(that all systems of reference are equivalent
for the formulation of the general laws of nature)
so we will formulate a psychological principle 
- that the mind consists of levels and that all 
levels have the same laws and consequently that 
all levels are equivalent for the formulation 
of the general laws of psychology. This I shall 
call the postulate of the "equivalence of levels."


(Freud or Jung incidentally would quite deny this 
as they say that thought at the unconscious level
is quite different from thought at 
the conscious level. However-


___


Note on the possible nature of inhibition, especially
as a possible explanation of and idea I have that 
excitation and inhibition are inseparable and must 


(48 of 250)


42. 


accompany one another. It is desired to 
excite A and inhibit B. This may be achieved 
by the anatomical structure of C - 


Fig 16. (hand-drawn diagram)


This would act like an ordinary filter pump, the 
impulse going along C past D would suck a
reverse change back along E, thus giving an 
impulse in the opposite direction and thus perhaps 
inhibiting B.


____


This idea of levels means that each layer is 
independent. It receives impulses from the next 
lower levels, integrates 
them a bit, and then passes them on to a higher level.
Consciousness is thus easy to explain - it is the 
topmost layer and concerns itself solely with the subtlest 
integrations of already complicated matter. But this
removes consciousness far back in the mind from 
reality. According to this idea, the sense corpuscles in 




(49 of 250)


43. 


the skin are the only parts of the body, or mind, that 
is in contact with reality; the rest of the mind is 
not in contact with reality but is only in contact
with the next lower layer. If the layers are 
L(1) (lowest) to L(n) (consciousness) the consciousness 
is only in contact with L(n-1). But this sounds 
incredible. When I look at a clock do I not see 
a clock? It sounds absurd to say No, but it may 
maintained with some possibility of truth that one does not 
see the clock as it is. The clock as it is is an empty 
"colourless" sense perception, whereas the clock and the 
reality that I am in contact with contains far more than
sense perceptions. It also contains, for me, memories 
and associations of many things that are obviously 
collected by the brain and handed to my conscious
mind with the sense perception of the clock. It is 
like a business manager in his private office,
when a visitor calls. The visitor walks in, but with 
him comes the manager's secretary, who says "Mr.
Smith who has called to see you about....." Here 
the manager is the conscious mind, and Mr. Smith is
the clock and the manager does not merely receive 
Mr. Smith, he also receives with him a
bundle of information about him collected by 


(50 of 250)


44. 


the secretary (the lower layers) on his way from 
the door (the skin) to the manager's office.


Hence we may say that the mind is composed
of layers, L(1) - L(n), each of which receives 
information from the layer 
beneath it and which integrates it further and then 
passes it on either as motor action at once, or, if 
it is too difficult, it refers it to the next 
layer above. One must admit that each layer 
can go to motor action as obviously not all action 
is controlled by the top L(n) layer.


It should be noted that this sharp division into 
layers is exceedingly doubtful and if persisted it 
may lead one into difficulties. But I think the 
postulate of the equivalence of levels is reasonable even 
if the levels are simply marked. This is 
perhaps just another example of the workings of the 
simple mechanism theory, for if there is 
only one simple mechanism in the brain it will 
be the same for all levels, of course.

It seems to me that the problem may be well divided 
with two stages - (a) the special theory of psychology
which will discuss how the animal reacts


(51 of 250) 


45. 


correctly to one stimulus and (b) the general theory of 
psychology which will discuss how the animal, able 
to react correctly to any single stimulus, manages to 
deal with conflicting stimuli. The first will 
discuss the simple "cognition - affect - conation" type 
of response whereas the second will take this and 
Then deal with the far more important and practical 
question as to how the animal deals with the usual
complex masses of stimuli that he receives naturally.
The first is the simpler, and the second must of 
course be based on the first. The first type 
must therefore be the primary object of study, and 
it seems to me that the fundamental questions to
be answered are - (a) the mechanism of the inborn 
complex reactions (chick who walks on leaving the shell),
(b) How conditioned reflexes lend automatically to become 
teleologically correct and perhaps (c) the nature of instincts.
If I can solve (b) or (c) I shall then be well on the 
path to solving the broader problem of the integration 
of those perfected reactions.

Note on epilepsy. It has secured to me for some 
time that epilepsy may quite well depend on some 
physico-chemical disturbance, especially of the 


(52 of 250)


46. 


"membrane permeability" type. Now according to 
(?)'s Journal, Vol. 2. No. 1. Jan. 1930. p. 16, (Ref(7)),
calcium and cholesterol on the one 
hand tend to loosen permeability (as shown by an
increase of electrical resistance) while potassium 
and lecithin tend to increase permeability. And 
calcium and cholesterol are just the two blood 
components which are known to be disturbed 
in epilepsy! Further it is known that calcium 
soaps tend to turn an oil in water emulsion
into a water and oil emulsion ((?)'s Journal p.17.
also - Surface tension by Willows and Hatschek. Pub.
Churchill. London. 2nd Edit. 1919. p. 92 et seq. (Ref 8)
also - Nature. 15.3.1930 in Reports of Societies (Ref 9).
authors show that by adjusting Na/Ca ratio, 
an emulsion of oil in water may be traced to 
an emulsion of water in oil by an electric current.
Another reference - Introduction to physics and chemistry 
of celloid. Emil Hatschek. Pub. Churchill. London.

forces and phenomena in physiology. Bayliss. Pub. (?).
London. 1923. p. 134 et seq. (Ref 11) Now Cloves (Ref 12) has
suggested that cell membranes are biphasic, 
being composed of lipoid of protein and water.


(53 of 250)


47. 


In the resting state the lipoid forms the 
continuous phase, in activity there is a reversal 
of phase, with the production of an emulsion
of lipoid in protein and water. We have seen 
(Nature reference) that this can be produced 
by a change in potential, and the change in phase, 
by altering the Donnan membrane conditions 
will produce a change in potential. This 
reaction is therefore cyclic and will be self 
propagating.


Now my theory of epilepsy is, that there is
an fall 
of calcium (or a rise in its antagonists). This 
leads to a reversal of the "Water in lipoid"
resting phase to the "lipoid in water" condition.
As soon as this change occurs, the (?) will 
redistribute themselves better - more calcium 
will come in, and more potassium will diffuse 
out and the system will revert to its original
phase. This explains, for the first time 
I believe, why a epileptic fit is self
curing.


The whole seems to be extraordinarily 
suggestive. With regard to possible

This theory leads at once to one practical 
point - namely that there should be an 
increased output of potassium after a fit.
This must be tested. It also suggests that 
plenty of calcium and no potassium in the

corner, will affect the next cell in the reverse

This naturally will alternate to and fro as it 
passes from cell to cell. Is this concept helpful?

Today I saw a girl in a train avidly reading a novelette.
What was she trying to do? Obviously she was trying 
as best she could to ease a tension. She was trying 
to find an outlet for the energy. She had struck a 
poor method but was doing her best. She was 
trying to ease a tension, she was trying to reduce her 
psychic energy. Every conation reduces the psychic 
energy of that part for the time being. Hence the 
cyclic nature of most activities, sex, hunger, thirst, 
ego instinct etc; all rise in energy steadily 
until one or the other dominates the field, it goes 
into conation and its energy is reduced.Then the next 
one rises up and so on. Conation in one direction always 
exhausts itself sooner or later. The animal which 
has discovered something pleasant does not go on 
doing it continuously for the rest of its life, it tires
of it, the pressure falls as one says, and it goes on 
to something else. In this way one may say that
psychic energy always tends to decrease, never to 
increase, and that this end is achieved by: - that 
part of the mind or brain which is at highest 
potential dominates the mind and passes into conation.
In this way its potential steadily drops until its
potential falls below that of some other part, which


(56 of 250)


50. 


then has top potential and it in turn dominates the 
mind and passes into conation and so on. But while
this reduction of energy or potential is going on,
the nerves are physiologically all increasing in potential.
This is obviously necessary otherwise the brain would 
just function until it was finished and would then 
stop.


There are thus two processes going on continuously,
a steady building up of potential, which probably
is purely physiological, and a reducing process
which belongs more to the psychical side.


What is this psychological energy or potential. I 
am almost certain that it must be a state of 
irritability of nerve cells by which a cell with 
high potential will discharge or fire off much more
easily than a cell of low energy. It 
is perhaps best to call it "irritability." An anaesthetised 
person has brain cells of negligible irritability.
He therefore has no psychic energy. There is nothing 
to reduce, so he does nothing. All this fits perfectly.


All this seems fairly straightforward and reasonable.
There is, however, a possibility which is at the 
moment rather obscure. To continue the above


(57 of 250)


51.


idea, each cell should pass on its impulse to that 
cell with which it is connected, which has highest 
irritability. This sounds eminently reasonable.
This irritable cell, when once stimulated, obeys the 
all or nothing law and thus carries a full, normal
impulse. This theory would make the path, not
so much a question of finding out the final
path which was at highest irritability, as rather 
a sort of fluid moving along of the impulse, having 
no idea where it was going to arrive at eventually 
but being determined from hand to mouth so to 
speak as it wen along. In this case, of course,
the first decisions would exercise a very 
great controlling effect on the ultimate destination.
Assume the think lines to be high irritability : -

The numbers indicate 
possible end points. 
It will end at (6)
If the first primary 
division has been 
different, however,
If would have ended
at (2), an entirely 
different result. 


(58 of 250)


52.


Having passed along to (6), however, the irritability of those 
cells would be reduced. We know now therefore : -

It will go to (2) now.


And after that : -

Note on learning. Imagine this simple fish (Fig 19).
If a pain stimulus comes from the back it must pull 
its fins backwards and thus go forwards away from the 
stimulus and vice versa. But at first it may either go 
forwards off the stimulus or backwards on to the stimulus,


*Now known as the “serial” distribution of impulses.


(61 of 250)


55.


and it must learn which to do. Similarly for the 
front end : - 


Fig. 19. (hand-drawn diagram)
A stimulus from the back will go up A, along both B’s (since 
it is symmetrical) and must then choose C. This arrangement 
is impossible however on our theory as having gone along 
B it will just discharge that cell which is of highest 
irritability. 


Try this arrangement : - 


(62 of 250)


56.


Fig. 20 (hand-drawn diagram)


Then, if the stimulus comes up A, it must go up B 
symmetrically, and then down E, while if it comes up F,
it must go down D. Assume that it does the wrong 
thing first. Pain stimulus comes up A -> B -> D.  As a
result the fin? is pulled forwards and the animal backs
on to the stimulus - so that the stimulus continues.
This will go on until the irritability of the D bundle 
is reduced below that of E, when the impulse will
change over to E. As a result the fin will be
pulled backwards and the animal shoot (sic) forwards and the 
stimulus will stop, which is what the animal "wanted."
Now we must find a reward method which will 
reinforce this path and perhaps block the other.
What has happened? The stimulus has come down 


(63 of 250) 

57.

B and has exhausted D and has then changed over to E. 
At E however the stimulus stopped. This is, as far
as I can see, the only criteria that E and D have to
go on, it changed over from D to another set, whereas
at E, it stopped. We may therefore postulate, 
if a stimulus goes through a synapse to a nerve
cell, and then changes over to another, that synapse 
is not reinforced, but if a stimulus goes through 
a synapse and cell and then the impulse stops, that
synapse has it (sic) resistance lowered. Here the synapse
BD is left as it was but the synapse BE is
facilitated. 
Note that the synapses CD, CE are quite
unaffected, so that if an impulse comes up F, the
animal will have to learn again. 
This mechanism corresponds to my previous idea 
that learning consists of a stepping down of unwanted
synapses, rather than a building up of new
synapses.
How on earth does the above stimulus 
postulate work? What is its physio-chemical mechanism?
I cannot say at the moment.

It has occurred to me that with the masses of long spidery cells one
sees in the cortex (e.g. any (Golgi preparation), surface phenomena
must play a great part. Surface tension for instance must
be low otherwise the cells could never extend so far.
Or, if they were joined at the ends in a network then I believe
there would be a crushing force on the brain (but am not
sure). ? Is mental deficiency due to a lack of S.T.
reducing bodies whereby the S.T. is too high and prevents the
cells from spreading and branching out as they should do?
It should be possible to test this experimentally.

Note that Hirschfelder and Serles (Ref. 13). have investigated 
the physical chemistry of hypnosis and they find that
in spite of their diverse chemical conditions, they all
have one property in common - that when added 
to an emulsion of oil in water, they convert the oil in
water phase to a water in oil phase. The effect of this 
is greatly to raise the electrical resistance of the emulsion.
This change of phase business is being pointed
at in so many ways that one may almost take it
for granted. Certainly it is amply justified to 
assume that it is so for the purposes of getting on
with the theory.

Note on Golgi preparations. I have noticed in
Golgi preparations that of the cells present in a section,
only a few take on the stain. The cells either

otherwise. 

Notes on conditioned reflexes from Brain(?) (Ref 14) p. 233.
(quoting Pavlov).

1) Apparently all the laws of excitation apply
equally and quite equivalently to inhibition and
the latter may be justifiably be considered
as negative excitation i.e. inhibitions can 
undergo summations etc just as excitations
Do.

2) Every bit as important as the above, he 
concludes that just as one may consider a wave 
of inhibition (dynamic) so one may consider
neurones to be in a state of inhibition (static).
This latter (the possibility of static changes)
I had already decided was possible. The 
continued, but interrupted stimulation of a complex
without conation, leads to a high state of tension.


(66 of 250)

60.

This would not be possible if each impulse arrived
and just stopped and vanished at once. Similarly with the 
(blank) effect in reflexes. The two are almost 
certainly identical mechanisms. On the other hand,
I do not believe that the static condition lasts
indefinitely. It is inconceivable that say, a slight
tap on the patellar tendon is sufficient to produce
a response (knee jerk), if followed by another 
gentle tap tomorrow, and so on, would eventually 
produce a jerk after perhaps a month.
Sherrington's humoral theory, quoted in Samson
Wright (Ref. 17), also agrees on this, where he
postulates that the E or I substances or states
slowly disperse and eventually vanish. All this 
applies in cases where an impulse is insufficiently 
perviated. In these cases the neurons etc remain
in a state of heightened tension which slowly falls
to zero. On the other hand repeated perviation
undoubtedly leads to much more permanent changes
in the system (permanent learning etc).

Note on excitation and inhibition. These
too are to be considered as equivalent as their
differences simply as the differences between


(67 of 250)


61. 

positive and negative deviations from zero. 
Note, and this is a point against my theories, that
the oil water emulsion theory only allows two states,
and not the three needed above (+,-, and 0). 
We therefore need some additional postulate.
If we assume that any one cell may be at
one moment excitatory and the next moment
inhibitory, we land in difficulties, for we 
cannot explain how the "oil-water" can give rise
to three states (+, -, and 0. It is possible that
direction of conduction would give the third
possibility (one direction -+, other direction 
= o) but this seems, offhand, to be unlikely.
We have to assume therefore that other neurones
have to come in. They may come in either as 
permanently inhibitory cells, or as temporary inhibitory 
cells, the temporary part perhaps depending on which
dendron the impulse goes down. It is possible that 
the inhibition is always supplied by the cells of the
next highest layer. This would mean that the
top layer would inhibit (where necessary) the 
lower layer, but would have nothing to inhibit
it; i.e. the reactions and integrations of the 
top layer would all have to pass with (blank).


(68 of 250)

62.

It is difficult off hand to see whether this is 
reasonable or not but I see nothing against it 
at the moment. After all, the animal has
got to react sooner or later, and if the impulse
has been referred up and up as being too difficult 
for each layer in turn, it is no good for the 
top layer to inhibit and stop action, - the animal 
has got to (sic) something about it, - and the best it
can do is to refer it to the top layer, and since
there is then no further authority for it to
appeal to, then let the top layers solution
pass into action as being the best that the
animal to (sic?) do.

Semole (Ref. 18) was able to induce sleep (= inhibition
a/c to Pavlov (5)) by the injection of a dilute solution of
CaCl2 in the region of the floor of the 3rd ventricle, and
showed that KCl was antagonistic.

Cloetta and Thomann (19) found that the blood 
calcium was lower in sleep, both normal, and
that produced by sedatives and hypnosis.
A method of discovering the essential mental
mechanisms. it has occurred to me that it may


(69 of 250)

63.

be possible to discover the essential mental
mechanisms by considering the number and
nature of the disorders which may occur. Then by
pairing off the disorders, one may be able, by
considering each pair as excess and deficiency 
to obtain an idea as to the number of independent mechanisms.

Note on narcolepsy. On reading re: narcolepsy, it 
seems to me that it may be the the opposite of 
epilepsy, but with inhibition instead of excitation.

For narcolepsy see Adie (20), also Wilson (21).

In trying to work out the mechanism of various reactions,
it has dawned on me that no adequate reaction can occur
entirely de motu. All new reactions are merely improvements
on an old one. Thus Pavlov's conditioned reflexes are
obtained by modifying or adding to a previously
existing one; without a previously existing salivation
reflex it is impossible to obtain one. Similarly
having modified the inborn reflex by adding
conditioned excitation to it, he can then 
modify that still further and add on a


(70 of 250)


64. 


conditioned inhibition. But in no case can
the reaction arise de (?). All reactions, and 
psychology must be reduced ultimately to 
exceedingly complicated modifications of the original
inborn reflexes or tendencies. I shall call this 
the principle of modification.


With regard to the idea of what one may call
“ultimate inborn anatomical localisation”, i.e. the
idea that every synapse joins just so and that the 
whole brain is exactly preformed before birth,
this idea is quite inadequate for two reasons :-


1. because the insects show this type of 
organisation and man’s reactions are different 
from the insects in that they are adaptable and 
modifiable, whereas the insects they are rigid. 


     (b) because man can do many things such 
as ride a bicycle, etc which have to be learnt,
and are obviously not inborn from natural selection.


     (c) Because if one part of the brain, such as 
the cerebellum is destroyed, the rest of the brain 
can learn to take over its functions to some 
extent. No one will suppose that the brain


 (71 of 250)


65.


carries “spare parts” in case another part is lost


For these reasons I have no hesitation in 
rejecting the theory completely.


On the other hand there is evidence that some 
parts of the C.N.S. are built on this plan. i.e. 
the knee jerk and intestinal reflexes are obviously
inborn and are obtained by the person without experience, and
if the tracts are destroyed, the brain cannot 
replace them. They are the foundations. If 
they go they cannot be replaced. On the other 
hand, the superstructure, if damaged, may 
be replaced again on the same foundations.


________


Take the simple conditioned reflex, try to work out 
its mechanism.


During the preliminary learning, evidence of 
new connections is not seen (as they are not 
functioning yet) so to find out what has 
happened must look at the results.


Now the simple cond. Reflex is formed 
1. by setting the primary reflex in motion. This 
means that the sensory nerves,
connectors and efferent nerves are all acting


 (72 of 250)


66.


While they are acting we pass in a second,
indifferent stimulus. Later we find that 
this also activates the reflex. Obviously
therefore, the second stimulus has linked 
up to the motor centre of the reflex, i.e. we 
now have : - 


Fig 21. (hand-drawn diagram)


i.e. the course of the original reflex is A -> B -> C.
While this is working, an indifferent stimulus 
from the ear fluids this tis tract working, and following 
the principle of perviation turns down it and so
escapes to the gland. The fact that the tract
D -> C has been perviated by a current leaves it 
open, or “sets the points” so that later an 
impulse from D will turn down C. Note that 
if you sound a bell, say, any reflex which
is working will become conditioned by it.
Therefore it seems to me to be the inevitable
conclusion that any indifferent stimulus must


(73 of 250)


67. 


pass over the whole brain and spinal cord*. We must 
therefore, I think, regard a working brain as one 
in which there are a number of well established 
tracts doing the ordinary day’s work, while at the 
same time there are masses of indifferent stimuli
pouring in and joining in with the established 
tracts. The vast number of the latter, of course,
are never repeated and suffer “inhibition by 
extinction” (Pavlov 15) and are never heard of again.


I think the stimulus must spread over the 
whole brain or system, also, because the most
unnatural stimuli may be used to condition
a reflex. Bright lights, the appearance of a 
square, and so on, may be used. It can scarcely
be argued that any direct natural tracts
for there exist from the eye, ear etc to the 
“salivary centre.” It is therefore more probably 
that the stimulus just spreads in all directions
until it finds an exit.


There is one other possibility, and that is, that
instead of the stimulus joining the functioning 
tract directly, as in Fig 21, it is possible that 
the tract A -> B - > C goes off branches to the 
cortex , so that while A,B,C is working, there


*Principle of total irradiation


(74 of 250)


68. 


will also be a signal, so to speak, or 
replica of it showing on the cortex and the 
auditory stimulus may join on to that. This 
seems, however, to add a good deal of 
complications. It must be remembered that 
these mechanisms, whatever they are, have 
been developed from very simple beginnings 
by evolution and are therefore likely to be,
when one gets down to the fundamentals,
essentially simple.

Note on nerve conduction. If nerve conduction 
consists of a wave of altered permeability, it 
should be noticed that as soon as the 
permeability alters, diffusion of previously non
diffusible ions will occur, so that when the 
wave has passed and the membrane has returned 
to its previous state, the distribution of ions
will not be the same as before. This will
have to be put right. Hence the latent 
period. 


It should be noted that the old idea that 
nerve conduction was unfatiguable in that it 
used no energy was obviously absurd as
(75 of 250)


69.


a movement of ions has occurred. This 
constitutes an electric current with it accompanying

must be supplied by the nerve cell.

It has just occurred to me that to talk of “strong
inhibitions” or “weak ---” is not exact as there are 
two independent variates, so to speak, concerned in this 
there are two types of inhibitions which may vary 
Quantitatively and independently --- (a) the physiological,
almost biochemical process of inhibition may be 
weak or strong and (b) there are also the  
inhibitors acquired by conditioning (experience)
which may be weak or strong. The first is
probably largely determined by heredity and 
chemical environment (endocrine and what not)
whereas the second (which was the first) is 
acquired by education. A child for instance
may be born with strong powers of inhibition,
like Pavlov’s dog “Brains” (Ref 5) but may be
brought up in a very free and easy atmosphere so 
that higher psychical inhibitions are very small


(76 of 250)


70.


and feeble. Such a child I should imagine 
would become a very stable adult, with few
psychological inhibitions to strain the mechanisms, but with 
ample inhibitory powers in reserve should the 
occasion arise. On the other hand, imagine
the unfortunate plight of a child with poor
powers of inhibition, subject to an environment 
which calls for great powers of inhibition.
Such a child will obviously break down 
easily. This is to illustrate the difference
between the two parts of “inhibition.”


1. Innate powers of inhibition
2. Acquired inhibitory reflexes


Note on drug addiction. A patient who has started 
the drug habit soon acquires a terrific desire for 
them which very quickly overpowers all other opposing 
forces e.g. the case quoted by Vick who was given 
morphia ad lib. For 1 week and who had the most 
tremendous struggle to get rid of the habit.


If the pleasure pain theory is correct, this easy 
and intense addiction to a drug must mean that 
the drug produces the intensest pleasure. But 
this does not fit. There are other pleasures


 (77 of 250)


71.


apparently more intense (sex etc) which however
do not lead to such addiction. Furthermore,
the subjective feeling of pleasure is probably
not very intense. This suggests that the pleasure-
pain reaction does not work according to the 
subjective feeling of pleasure, but according 
to some deeper, unconscious pleasure, and that 
morphia, cocaine etc are the drugs, or “environment”
par excellence which lead to produce this “pleasure”
It is probably that this “pleasure” is really a 
physio chemical condition. For instance, it might 
be that morphia renders the cells highly stable
and inactive and that sen is pleasant because it also 
tends to produce this state and so on. There
are many possibilities.


Therefore I would suggest that a study of 
the action of morphia and cocaine on (a) excitation
and inhibition, (b) monomolecular films of lipoids,
(c) Paramecium (d) oil-water emulsions etc, might 
give a clue as to the underlying physio chemical
changes which the brain tries to reproduce and which 
we recognise subjectively as “pleasure.”

Observation on a case of involutional melancholia. A patient
developed acute but mild melancholia characterised by 
(a) a desire to do nothing but gaze into space, (b) a desire
to say nothing (c) a desire to receive no stimuli (a
strong stimulus normally demanding attention and reaction to 
it was met merely with signs of internal conflict).


Obviously we are dealing with acute inhibition in the 
higher levels. Now this patient had always 
been active (as so many of them are) and often of 
the rather forcibly active type -- always rather 
deliberately bright, active and cheerful. It suggests
that she had been repressing (or inhibiting) inhibitions 
and that inhibition processes, having been dammed 
back for a long time, at last burst forth and 
swamped excitation. It suggests strongly too that
inhibition (and excitation)  if not “worked off” are very 
persistent and do not fade away quickly if not 
worked off, or “perviated.” This conclusion, however,
Is the opposite of that on p. 60. One of the 


(79 of 250)


73. 


difficulties deciding this question is that one does not 
know whether the force (excitatory or inhibitory) is derived 
from the past, and how much may be due to present 
stimuli which may seem harmless enough, but 
which, of course, may be full of significance and 
“power” owing to association. Is there any possible
way, experimentally of cutting off all present stimuli?
It would be difficult to achieve. It might well 
however give very interesting and important results.


The above considerations will be will be (?)
also bring up again the old suggestion of - are 
inhibition and excitation inseparable like action and 
reaction in Newton’s second law?

In the obsessive states, the patient reacts to one 
thing in the same way that he would react 
(if he permitted himself) to another. i.e. the person
more or less confuses the two and as the one is 
inhibited, he turns to the thing next like it. But
note - the resemblance between the two is not 
a question of approximate sensory resemblance,
Rather it is a question of “affect” resemblance.

with a different feeling (?), then they will 
not do as substitutes for one another.

This question of resemblance and substitution is most 
clearly seen, perhaps, in dream symbolism. Here we 
have on thing substituted for the other. This often 
shows the above “affect resemblance” very clearly, e.g.
the dream I had where a black thunder cloud 
coming up over the horizon was a symbol for my 
father. Here, of course, there is not the slightest
resemblance of shape, size, colour etc but a 
very definite resemblance between the two emotional 
attitudes aroused in me by the two objects.


On the other hand one also sees examples of the 
other type. The snake-phallus connection is 
a clear example. Here the sensory resemblance 
is marked, but it is just possible that affect 
resemblance plays a part as snakes are said 
to be dangerous etc. In any case there is no 
doubt that sensory resemblance does play a part

Here. We may therefore postulate two principles 
of substitution: - the two things must
resemble one another but they may resemble
each other (a) by similarity of sense stimuli 
             (b) ____________ affect produced.


A third method brought out by Freud is that 
the substitution may take place when there is 
neither of the two above concerned directly, but 
where the two things are strongly associated 
by some past experience which has strongly 
linked up two very different things.


Note that in sleep some things are repressed 
whereas other things leak through (the dreams)
i.e. under the general inhibition of sleep 
there is still a process of differential inhibition
going on. The “generalised inhibition” of sleep
cannot therefore be really generalized and (?)

Further note on the validity of the concept of p. 42. Note 
that the vestibular nerve supplies the brain with 
information as to position, but this information in its 
sensory aspect is primarily unconscious. We are
not conscious of impressions coming from the ear 
in their simple sensory character. What happens


(83 of 250)


77.


is that the labyrinth sends up impulses. These 
impulses are then integrated at a low level into 
“impulses” “patterns” or what not of position, this 
is then passed up to the conscious mind as an 
integrated but simplified system, and the 
mind reacts to the integrated system which it
receives and not according to the simple sensory 
stimuli. Or to put it rather more dramatically,
the lower level receives a complicated bundle 
of stimuli from the labyrinth. It sets to work 
on these and finds that that bundle means “down.”
It then passes on to the higher level a 
stimulus, quite different from the first lot,
and the higher level knows that this stimulus 
means “down” and then acts accordingly.


Again, in equilibration, the cortex or conscious 
mind does not have to bother to work out all 
the details. The integration of the simple sensory 
stimuli from the muscles and joints are carried
out by lower centres, chiefly the cerebellum. 
This works out all this and hands a simple 
message up to consciousness. This deals with 
it and again sends out a simple message of 
movement, and then the lower centres analyse this 


(84 of 250)


78. 


out and work out all the details which are 
carried out. The same thing applies in 
the sensory field to the question of stereoscopic
vision. This probably represents a very 
complicated form of integration, but it is 
not the conscious mind which works it out,
it is the unconscious lower levels. They
work it out and pass on to the conscious
mind a simple message that “the
book is nearer than the inkstand.” The
conscious mind then deals with this simple
Information. To use an analogy, the  
conscious mind then deals with this simple 
information. To use an analogy, the 
simple sensory impressions come up the 
spinal cord, say, as a number of bits of 
a jig saw puzzle. When the pieces are 
assembled, it is seen that there is a 
message written across the completed,
integrated mass which reads “the left (?)
is being flexed.” The integration of the 
jig-saw puzzle is done by the lower centres
which then holds up the completed picture
for the next layer to see. The next 
layer sees and reacts to the completed 
picture, it cares nothing about the

79.


shape, size etc of the masses of small pieces
which make up the completed pictures.

I have, in one or two notes, given “pain” a prominence 
which has been denied to “pleasure.” It is 
commonly supposed that “pleasure” and “pain” are 
(?) similar things but with a change of sign.
I now realise that this is not so after reading
(?) Stewart (Ref. 25) and I realise that it is 
reasonable to ascribe properties to “pain” that

I was thinking yesterday of our present complicated 
financial and commercial organisation. It is really 
very similar to the brain. There are masses of 
units (people or neurones). Each one behaves 
according to certain principles* without in the least 
bothering about what the ultimate effect on the 
world will be (i.e. if a man wants more 
money he gets a better job, or becomes better
Trained or works harder; he is always out to buy

cheaply and sell at a higher figure and so on)
and yet the system works perfectly and adjusts itself 
continuously to changing conditions in a way 
undreamed of by the individuals. This adaptation
and alteration to suit the changed circumstances
occurs rapidly and efficiently and amazingly purposively 
although the individuals may know nothing of 
what is occurring in the larger sense. e.g. 
if too many people are producing wheat there 
will be an excess of wheat and it is desired,
so to speak, that less wheat should be 
produced. What happens is that the farmers
cannot sell and have to drop their prices. The 
reduced income that they get will make the 
less efficient farms drop out (i.e. those that 
are growing on poor ground etc), and the 
supply of wheat will fall until it has 
reached a reasonable level. In this way
the situation has been changed in the best 
possible way - there has been an excess of 
wheat as the less efficient farms have 
ceased to be. But the important point is 
that not one of the people need know the
least bit about what is happening.* The


(87 of 250)


81.


system works quite automatically, and it does so 
by each person following out some simple 
scheme such as : - 


1. The law of supply and demand which controls 
prices.
     2)   The law that each individual shall
        endeavour to get the highest price
        For his goods.
     3) The law of the commercial competition
together with perhaps some other principles. If
each individual follows out each of these principles, then 
the system will work, no matter how blindly he 
may work. This important point is that a 
number of units, each of lowish intelligence,
may, by following a fixed plan, act together 
to produce of a system of much higher intelligence. 


This shows clearly that my theory of the 
brain is at least possible; my theory being 
that the brain is composed of neurones, and that 
each neurone follows some principle plan 
rigidly and blindly, and that by so doing, the 
brain, as a system will automatically produce 
the right reactions. Obviously the crux


(88 of 250)


82. 


of the matter is 


1. To discover the precise rules according
to which the nervous work, and 
      2) To demonstrate that, given these
Rules, the rest must inevitably follow.


The rules, when discovered can probably be 
written down on half a dozen lines, but 
the second part will be of infinite length 
and will show how all the masses of 
various clinical observations can be deduced 
from the few rules. Naturally, since the 
number of clinical observations made may 
be anything less than infinity, so, to explain
the whole lot would take any thing less than 
infinity to work out. But of course, the 
demonstration of the elaboration of the principles
need not include everything. Once it has 
been shown how various types of observations 
may be explained, it will be sufficient to 
leave it there and to leave it to others to


(89 of 250)


83. 


follow the method and work out their own details 
as required.


When one arrives at this point, the development 
of a mathematical type of symbolism, if possible,
would be of enormous assistance and convenience. 
(Cf. the symbolism developed in higher logic).


Here we come to a difficulty. 
Let us suppose that an observer from Mars
arrives on this world and sets to work to try and 
study our financial system. He sees, as we
do when observing the mind, that it shows 
integrated and purposive reactions to its environment
and by questioning individual people, labourers,
shop keepers etc he finds that the individuals 
not know the larger scheme of things. How 
is he to start? He may do it in two ways,
He may take an exceedingly complicated
society and try to pick out the individual 
reactions (just like studying the psychology of 
man and trying to pick up clues) or he may go 
to the other end, and by starting with the 
simplest possible society he may get a  firm 
grasp of what is happening there and may 


(90 of 250)


84. 


then pass slowly up, each time using his past 
knowledge to understand the next step until
he arrives eventually at the top. In mental
physiology he would start at the simplest 
forms (amoeba etc) and would stop there until 
he had discovered how that worked, and then 
he would slowly climb the animal kingdom 
until he reached man, but at every step he 
would have to make sure of that step before passing 
on to the next,because, to miss one step 
would completely tangle the who thing (?)
as one would (?) one essential principle, 
which latter would leave a horrible gap 
in one’s knowledge which might interfere in 
masses of different places.


Obviously, of the two methods the second is 
the surer. In the first method, great flashes 
of insight may reveal a lot but there are 
two strong arguments against it (a) it is very 
easy to go wrong and (b) to convince others there
is not comparison between the two. People 
will trust theories built up slowly from 
the observations of primitive organisms, but 
they will not trust theories built up on 


(91 of 250)


85. 


flashes of insight into the workings 
of highly complicated systems.


I think, therefore, that to solve this 
(vast) problem we must go back to the amoeba, 
paramecium, vorticella, euglena and the lower 
plants and bacteria. Especially must we decide
from them as to what activities are possible 
in a single cell. We may bring in as 
helpful various consideration derived from 
the higher animals but only 
as a guidance in the work. The ultimate 
decisions must rest on the evidence given 
by the organisms themselves. i.e. we may 
justly ask “does inhibition occur in a single
Cell?” and we may observe single cells to 
see if it does, but the answer must be in 
the single cells and the question but not be 
 answered by a flash of insight into the 
workings of higher multicellular animals. 


There is no doubt that that is the method.


It has one great advantage over the other “starting at 
the top” method, and that is that although a flash


(92 of 250)


86.


of inspiration may suddenly give one a concept of 
great value, that concept will not necessarily 
get one any nearer to the next. Thus in 
looking at the money “laws” on p. 81, it will
be seen that they are all pretty well independent .
The sense that knowing one of them does not 
help one to find the next, and indeed it is 
a necessary property of primary concepts that they 
be independent. On the other hand, in
“starting at the bottom” there is the tremendously 
useful evolutionary rule that each  
advance is an improvement on the immediately 
proceeding one. If one knows the present position
up to a certain point one can perhaps indicate
where the next improvement will occur and what 
it will be. It is essentially a continuous
improvement going by a series of almost imperceptible 
gradations. And naturally it is easier to
follow a train where, having reached a certain
point, one knows that the next step is very
near and needs a close inspection of the ground 
immediately around one, rather than to try and 
follow a trail where, having found one 
step, one has not the vaguest idea where to


(93 of 250)


87.


look for the next.


The thing to do therefore is to take up the 
protista and to find out what single cells can do.

diving Paramecia joined by a thread). (p. 147

Apropos of any idea of going to the Protista for 
guidance, one important point to be settled is 
to find the lowest level at which learning can
take place. One could reasonably define 
“learning” as the ability to form a conditioned 
reflex, this latter being, I should imagine,
the very essence of learning. This should be 
a fairly easy point to settle. It would give 
one an idea as to what complexity learning 
really involved. One might find 
that a few cells strung together was sufficient 
for learning, or one might find that even a 
frog’s brain is quite insufficient for learning.
The latter would, of course, indicate that learning 
was a very intricate and subtle process, and 
vice versa.

It seems to me that Hydra would form a convenient

starting point for the investigation. Anatomically it 
is simple, it has a definite multicellular nervous 
system, and above all, it shows examples of 
higher intelligence -- it has several reactions,
contraction in defence, food grasping etc, and 
it walks about, the latter particularly being a 
fairly involved operation. If we can work 
this out thoroughly we have solved 9/10ths of the 
problem.

Fundamental experiments to be conducted on Hydra.


1. To test for the presence of inhibition. To see if the 
defence reaction will inhibit the feeding reaction 
is simple for one feeds the animal and in the middle 
one applies a shock and sees if it will inhibit the 
other reaction. To test the opposite, graduale electric
shocks until one gets a defense reaction about 75%
of times. Then test with the same strength when 
feeding. The defence reactions may fall to,
say, 50%, then test for significance with X^2 : - 


                        Feeding        Resting        


defense reaction         10                 20                 30

Here X^2 = 8.33, x = 1, therefore significant. This esp. will need
adjusting with regard to detail. Note that the two 
inhibitions are not strictly comparable, for in the second 
one we are not testing whether a feeding reaction 
can intrude into and inhibit a defence reaction (which is 
the converse of (1) ).


(2) Test for learning. One way is to grow a side bud to 
full size without ever feeding it and then feed it 
one day and watch for incoordination etc.


(3) Fig 22. (hand-drawn diagram) A most important exp. is to touch it
at A and B, (1) with a pin (2) with 
food and see whether the reaction 
is determined by the site of the 
stimulus or by the nature of the stimulus. If it is 
the site only that counts, we need not bother about
the stimulus but need (?) all our attention to 
the nerve net. This would mean that it is the 
anatomy of the net which is of most importance. If
however it reacts according to the nature of the 
stimulus, then we must set to work to find out 
what it is in the stimulus which counts, taste,
touch etc. This last experiment is a most 
fundamental experiment.

It has occurred to me that the whole mechanism 
may be worked by wave mechanisms, considering 
them not as single waves : - 


Fig. 23 (hand-drawn diagram)


but as continued waves : - 


Fig 24. (hand-drawn diagram)


so that the whole thing would have to be worked 
out as wave mechanisms with many things 
appearing such as : - amplitude, wave length,
interference, beats, resonators, Fourier’s theorem and 
so on.


I have thought of this before but it has struck 
me today what a lot there is in it. First of all  
it offers an escape from what I had long 
considered to be an objectionable impasse - the 
theory of anatomical localization *, the idea that 
reactions were (?) a question of 
nerve tracts or paths (an idea much upheld by 
neurologists with its accompanying idea that 
the whole thing might be worked out by 




*The “framework” theory.

studying, with a super microscope, the exact (?)
from neuron to neuron. This idea I consider and 
have long considered to be hopeless. I cannot
see how the functions of mind can possibly be 
filled into much a scheme. I am of the opinion 
that the mechanisms of the brain will only be 
discovered by studying the functions of the 
living brain and not by studying the structure
of the dead brain. The “wave” theory of psychology 
offers a perfect escape from this theory. It 
should be noted that the “anatomical” theory of
psychology is exceedingly difficult to escape 
from -  we will notice the way in which it 
obtrudes itself again and again in these pages.
One is so used to thinking of pathways - 
roads which direct traffic, pipes directing fluids,
taps for turning the fluid and thus to produce a
different result, wires to carry electric currents,
and so on, that it is difficult to imagine anything 
not working on this plan. But there are machines
that work on this plan, notably wireless sets, where
it is not the metallic connections which count 
so much as the dynamic components, i.e. the 
H.F. current can go easily across a condenser where


(98 of 250)


91. 


there is no metallic bridge, and may be stopped 
by the H.F. (?) although there is a complete
metallic bridge through it. Hence in studying 
the “dead” wireless set one would get 
completely on the wrong track. To find how 
it works one must (?) it when working, 
when one would “see” at once that the 
dynamic conditions were quite different from 
the static.


The wave theory fits nicely in the following 
ways : - it would explain


1. The infinite variety of psychology and reactions 
and the way in which they may shade off from 
one reaction or idea to the next.


     (2) The effect of music (this conversely would give 
us a clue as to the nature, frequency etc of the
actual waves). 


     (3) the fact that an object can be recognized 
and identified in any part of the visual field, 
for it would set up a complicated train of 
waves which would be the same on whichever 
part of the visual cortex it happened 
to be projected.


(4) interference of the two sides of the visual 


(99 of 250)


92. 


cortex would produce beats, which would afford
a simple “explanation” of stereoscopic vision. 


(5) It would explain the way in which a “class”
of objects such as “dogs” are recognized at once 
although we may never have seen a dog
exactly like this particular dog before.


(6) the compounding of stimuli to form a whole
is easily explained.


(7) Local sign might be explained as differences
in wave length or form.


(8) The increase in intensity of a stimulus or 
sensation may be explained as an increase
in amplitude. 


(9) A single cell certainly can manufacture 
waves, note the continuous waves of stimulation
passing over Paramecium as shown by the 
cilia, and in (?) etc.


But note with regard to the concept of waves 
and Fourier’s theorem, where waves do not occur in 
actuality, i.e. the multidimensional waves
developed in the mechanics of the electron,
the appreciation of Fourier’s theorem to the 


(100 of 250)


93. 


diffusion of salts, heat etc where waves most
certainly do not exist. (?) (Ref. 26) 
has pointed this out.


For this wave theory to be ultimately established,
(a) the waves must be demonstrated experimentally,
and (b) the theory must also predict what cannot
be done, and not merely explain in new 
words what is already known.

Note on my idea that “anatomical localisation” must be 
given up and replaced by principles or laws of function. 
Driesch (Ref. 27) has produced strong evidence that 
development from the ovum follows the same type 
of mechanism. As von (?) has put it : -


“The essence of a framework consists in its being 
made of parts filled together; and when one tears it 
asunder, it is a framework no longer. If there is
an invisible framework present in the germ then when 
the germ is cut up, the framework must be cut up 
with it. Now a halved germ…. yields, not 
two half-animals but two animals of half the 
normal size. …. while an anatomical

framework must be destroyed by an anatomical 
interference, since it is expanded in space, a rule,
which in its very nature is no-spatial, cannot be 
severed by the knife. Either the possibility of 
embodiment is taken from it by destruction of the 
material, or, if that does not happen, still it must 
come to expression even with reduced material.”

Function versus structure -- It is obvious that

Note on reflexes. (?) Wilson (Ref. 28) has pointed
out that all the reflexes are abolished in narcolepsy 
and says that that fact has caused him to revise 
his views on reflexes and to regard them much more 
as functional than “organic.” 


Now the reflexes could be explained functionally
as follows : - First, how is electricity directed
on its path, which is often very complicated? The 
answer lies in the existence of pressures, with 
the resulting movements when the pressures are 
unbalanced. Similarly one could suppose a 
functional mechanism of reflexes by assuming 
that the skin receptor is at high potential and 
the corresponding muscles at low “pressure”. A 
current (impulse) would therefore tend to pass from 
the one to the other. The skin pressure is carried
up the posterior roots to the spinal and the 
muscle pressure is carried from the anterior roots 
or horns. Therefore we may simplify it by 
assuming that the posterior horns (and their 
afferent nerves and receptors) are at high pressure,


 (103 of 250)


96. 


the anterior horns (with their efferent nerves and muscles)
are at low pressure). Any impulse 
coming up to the posterior horn will, therefore,
like electricity or steam, tend to go to 
the place of low pressure and escape there. But
if all the anterior horns are at low pressure,
why does not the impulse escape at all the anterior 
horns? The answer may be that the posterior 
horns are nearer the anterior horns of their own 
segment than the other anterior horns and therefore 
the potential gradient will be deeper 
from a posterior horn to its own anterior horn 
than to any other anterior horn. Most, or all
of the reflex arcs come out at the 
same segment as they go in. This theory would 
need anatomical localisation only as far in as
the roots of the nerves. The intramedullary 
path would be variable while the reflex would 
be constant - i.e. a “functional” mechanism.


One might imagine that the nerves with 
synapses form a sort of sloping tube with 
partitions at various levels, and filled with water,
so that there is a continuous tendency for the
water to flow down (Fig 25) : - 


(104 of 250)


97.


Fig 25. (hand-drawn diagram)


Then, under ordinary conditions the partitions 
might be just strong enough to hold 
the pressure of water. If however one gave 
a tap or blow at the wp, the extra pressure
would be just strong enough to burst the 
partitions, and if the passing of a partition 
did not weaken the wave, it would pass 
right down to the other end to the muscle.
It would, I think, tend to go down the line 
of steepest gradient as there the 
partitions would be under greatest stress (or strain)
and would give most easily.  


This hypothesis is illuminating and probably good 
but it needs further elaboration as it offers 
no chance of any alteration of the path of an 
Impulse.

I am of the opinion more and more that to 
understand this problem one must get more and 


(105 of 250)

more away from adult man and his reactions; they 
are so utterly complicated. One must get down 
to Paramecium and Hydra for one’s knowledge of 
fundamental principles, and, to discuss adult man,
one must go back to the child and show how 
these principles slowly build up. During the
first year of life the child apparently learns 
nothing (except one or two tricks). And yet 
this whole year obviously is not spent in 
idleness in the brain. Obviously during this 
time the brain is hard at work building up 
and integrating and compounding and elaborating. With 
every movement the child is learning, but it 
is not until about a year has passed that 
the brain is really ready to start showing 
results. All the previous work is interior 
work, “setting the points” and so on. 
The brain is being built up into an elaborate
anatomical and functional piece of mechanism,
and the adults reactions are the play of impulses
on this already vastly complicated mechanism.
As psychoanalysis has shown, to understand 
the present reaction one must know the past,
and this is a general principle which applies all

out one’s mechanisms in terms of Hydra and 
the development of the child. Then having
got that one would then take the infant 
and show how it will slowly build up to the 
adult.

J. von Uexkull firmly believes in the idea that the 
C.N.S. works according to what he calls
“function rules” and not according to an “anatomical
framework”. (Ref 29.)


His theoretical points do not help me much except 
that (on p. 169), he comes to the conclusion that the 
aim of all “function circles” is the annihilations 
of indications, i.e. a bee finds some honey.
it drinks till there is none left and then goes away, - 
- it has annihilated the honey and the indication.
Similarly in the sexual act and so on. This concept 
may prove of value.


He also points out one important concept, which is 
the general idea that for a proper working, two things 
are necessary (a) a “function rule” and (b) a framework 
upon which the “function rule” can show itself.
The important relationship of this to neurology is 


(107 of 250)


100.


obvious. 


Uexkull quotes Harrison and Braus as having transplanted 
the growing facial nerve to the sciatic region and they 
then find that the transplanted facial nerve grows 
into the leg and supplies all the new and completely 
unfamiliar muscles with nerves just as efficiently 
as does the normal sciatic. This, I think,
disposes of the “framework” theory pretty effectively.


Uexhill talks of the idea of development and specialisation
in the growth of the individual as (?) loss of genes. 
Whether this is his idea or not I do not know. It is 
certainly a fascinating idea and a very crisp and clean 
cut theory. Note that the insects show the 
framework method at its highest whereas the 
higher animals have developed and perfected the 
“function rule” method. The latter is probably 
more complicated and may involve more
“degrees of freedom”. Is this connected with 
the fact that the insects have as a rule fewer
chromosomes than the mammals? (I believe
that that is the case). 


Note that Uexkull constantly points out that
a function rule must have a suitable framework 
on which to express itself 


(108 of 250)


101. 


Uexkull (p. 243) concludes his chapter on “Species” 
with “...there can be no doubt that every 
species represents really an
independent organism with a character of its own 
but endowed with tremendous longevity.” This 
idea quite fits in with my idea that an
accumulation of individuals can show an organisation 
and functions and ability which is much greater than 
that of any individual member (apropos of the 
assembly of nerve cells in the brain). Thus 
Uexkull (p. 246) … “The species is a thousand 
times richer than the individual, and consequently
impossible to grasp in its entirely if we consider 
it merely as the sum of its members.”


(p. 254) “Now Rouse,....., showed that the good
(namely the finished framework capable of functioning)
is more certain than the route followed 
(i.e. more certain than the route followed
(i.e. the normal course of development).” This 
is excellently exemplified by Harrison and Braus’ work 
(p. 100 of this notebook).


Uexkull himself (p. 283) suggests a possible theory 
of the workings of a nerve-net by postulating that the 
stimuli give rise to a “melody” in the nerves and that 
the nest is governed by resonators.


(109 of 250)

He says (apropos of the “framework” idea) -- “it is 
obvious that the form, once destroyed, cannot produce 
the form anew.”

Freud (Ref 30. P. 266) has shown, apropos of the 
mechanism of condensation in dreams, that each 
dream thought lying behind the dream appears
again and again in the dream in various places,
and that (vice versa) each bit of the dream contains 
masses of various dream thoughts. This may 
be represented as : -


Fig 26. (hand-drawn diagram)


i.e. every conative tendency in the unconscious keeps 
appearing in all the episodes in the manifest
content of the dream and vice versa. It seems 
almost certain on a priori reasons that we may 
make a general law or conclusion that all 
the conative tendencies contribute to the dream,


(110 of 250)


103. 


and that, were the analysis deep enough, we should
ultimately find everything that was in the
unconscious. 


It is certain, in my opinion, that the essential
mechanisms of dreams are the same as those of 
waking life, even right down to the reflexes.


Now it occurs to me, as I have already expressed 
on p. 2. that a mechanism of dreams must involve
some concept of pressures or intensities. This would 
help to explain the easy flowing production of the 
manifest dream content, and there are other 
evidences for this : - the fact that excitation and 
inhibition fight for mastery in reflexes (see (?)
Pavlov Ref. 5.) and that there are relative intensities of the 
(?) that determine the outcome, and these 
intensities may be altered so that the outcome
may be inhibition or excitation according to 
whether reinforcement has occurred and according to the 
nature of the stimuli.

area, who was studied by Goldstein and (?) Ref 33, was able
to locate, by spasmodic reflex movement, a contact 
spot on the skin, though he had no idea of the 
location of the stimulation. The authors concluded 
from this that tactile space does not exist.” (Now
this may possibly suggest that space does not really
exist but that it is a convenient concept to join 
up and simplify the complicated stimuli entering the 
Brain. Since Einstein (Daily Mail 7.6.1930) has 
shown that given space, all the rest - matter,
gravitation, electricity etc must follow, it means 
that the mind and its rules are the only things
known i.e. the mind creates space and this creates
matter and its properties.) 


p. 138 Lapicque has described (?) chronaxy 
(Ref 34), in a paper entitled “Principles for a theory 
of nervous functions”. This sounds to the point.


(112 of 250)


105. 


“Lapicque has demonstrated that such muscle has 
the name chronaxy as its nerve, and that if the 
chronaxy off one of the two was modified in any 
direction whatsoever, the contradiction of the muscle,
under the influence of the excitation of the nerve,
became more and more difficult to effect and for a certain
relation between the chronaxies - when one became 
double the other - could not be elicited at all
(effect of (?); on the other hand a parallel 
variation of the two chromaxies did not change 
the excitability.” “These relations of the nerve 
and the muscle suggest the relation of one neurone 
to another.”  


p. 140. Bourguignon (quotes in Pieron) (Ref 35) has 
Found that the flexors of the toes have the same 
chronaxy as the sensory nerve of the sole of the foot.
The extensors however have only half the chronaxy 
with a pyramidal lesion the chronaxy of the flexors
diminishes while that the the extensors increases to that 
of the sensory nerve. This, if established, 
constitutes a most fundamental observation for it 
at once offers an escape from the
framework theory and shows how a function-rule 
may control even a reflex.

p. 141 (?) (Ref 36) has worked out a theory on 
this basis. --- “When a neurone A has forced
neurone B to vibrate with it by reason of the intensity 
of the excitation and in spite of the difference between
the vibratory mode of 13 and its own, it modifies in 
this way the mode of 13 and brings it nearer its 
own. It causes this approximation for a considerable 
Time, but gradually recovers its original mode  
Except for a slight remainder which continues 
to diminish slowly, without ever disappearing
Altogether.” This is to explain memory,
Association, and (?).

p. 215 “We may say roughly that there are three levels


(116 of 250)


109. 


the level of the spinal cord, the level of the sub-
corneal ganglionic masses of the brain stem, and the cortical
level of the pallium.” 


He regards the two lower levels as being controlled
by the anatomical arrangement of the synapses,
which is determined by neurobiotaxis.


Re the three levels, if space with is three
dimensions is to be reduced to a projection of the 
mind, it is difficult to see why three
dimensions should be found by us in space.
There are perhaps three levels and this may 
be the reason. It is about the only “three”
that I have come across. In that case, time 
as the 4th dimension (which we only appreciate
poorly) may represent a new and even higher 
level developing - a new-supra-pallial 
system.


p. 222. He points out that an action,  such as 
cycling, having been learnt by the cortex,
may become as automatic as to drop out 
from consciousness, into the foreconscious as 
Freud would say, but it still remains
cortical and uses the same paths; i.e. it never 
(?) down, say, to the corpus striatum.


(117 of 250)

He regards the spinal cord up to and including the corpus 
striatum as being inborn, fixed, and uneducable
in its arrangement and function whereas the pallium
has no functions inborn but must 
learn all and can learn everything. The pallium
is born with no functions and is completely and adaptable
organ which adapts itself to whatever comes to it.
It is dangerous and confusing to speak of a
cortical reflex, or saying that knitting may 
become reflex. In this division spinal 
cord and brain stem -- pallium) the paleocerebellum 
functions with the lower two and the neocerebellum 
with the pallium.


It occurred to me today (13.6.30), that I am still 
ticklish whereas others are not. This seems 
to suggest thalamic overactivity in some way. Would 
this do for you a possible theory of dementia praecox?
The highly affective nature of the sensations would 
make it much more difficult for the animal to 
adjust itself. This corresponds vaguely to my idea 
that dem. Praecox is due to excess of energy rather than 
a deficiency. A deficiency of “thalamic” sensation 
would probably lead to the Sybil Booty type - very
stable but (?).

One method of deciding whether any given reaction
is fixed (inborn) or plastic (learned) is to ask - 
is it constant through the species or is it peculiar 
to that individual. Thus the knee jerk is constantly
present throughout the species, while the bicycle-
riding reactions are not but appear only 
spasmodically in individuals.

An instructive analogy to the development of the C.N.S. 
is the vascular system, especially the veins. The large
veins grew according to exact anatomical localisation
and are constant through the species. The medium 
sized veins are fairly constant, while the small
veins are quite inconstant from individual 
to individual. But although the small
veins and venules are so inconstant from the 
anatomical or framework point of view, they are


(119 of 250)


112.


nevertheless absolutely constant from one point of 
view, namely, from the function point of view,
i.e. they all grow so as to fill the rigid 
rule that they shall drain all areas efficiently.
They must fulfill that function but the details 
are left to them.


I believe that this is how the C.N.S. develops.
The large features are laid down according 
to strict anatomical rules and are quite constant 
from individual to individual. One the other 
hand the smaller details, and especially the 
finest details such as the meeting of synapses
are governed by some general function rule 
and the details are left to the individual cells
to apply according to their particular circumstances.
One of the obvious rules is that each dendron 
shall terminate with another dendron to form a 
synapse. Whether there are other rules as well
I cannot say now.

Note on learning and chronaxy. On page 39 we decided 
that “pain reverses the reaction.” Now Bourguignon 
has shown that the alteration in chronaxy is responsible 
for the alteration from flexion to extension in the 
(120 of 250)


113.


Babinski reflex. Here the reaction has been altered;
we decided that pain alters the reaction. Does pain 
act by altering the chronaxy of the cell?


Let us suppose an arrangement like this : -


Fig. 27 (hand-drawn diagram)


 Now since flexor has chronaxy (1) just as (?), impulse 
up the tactile nerve will go down to flexor. If however 
an impulse goes up the spino thalamic tract to Betz cell
and this reverses the chromax, then the stimulus will 
reverse the chromaxies and will cause extension.


Now let us apply it to the “fish” on p. 56. I see at once 
that the mechanism there still hangs on to the old idea of 
developing a path, and must therefore be rejected.


First note that the single fibres A and F must have added 
a “pain” path. We will rebuild it thus : -

I note that the previous example uses a pain stimulus as 
the basis of the motor reaction, whereas in Fig 27 I use 
a tactile stimulus to supply the motor impulse and a 
pain stimulus to “set the points.” Either of these is 
a priori possible. This point must be settled later.

p. 131. Kennedy (no ref.) cut nerves to extensor and flexor

disturbance.” i.e. impulses are motor, secretory 
etc according to their terminations.


p. 135. Lapique has introduced concept of rheobase 
and chronaxy.


“Rheobase is the intensity in volts of a constant 
current closed instantaneously which will excite if 
continued indefinitely, and chronaxy is the time
required for excitation by a current of twice that 
Intensity. The first is determined with a battery,
voltmeter and rheostat; the second by the discharge 
of a condenser. Non polarisable electrodes are 
used. The condenser discharges are led to the 
house through a resistance; the difficulty 
of the variable yet high resistance of the tissue 
itself was overcome by interpolating a shunt 
of such low resistance as to make the resistance 
of the tissue negligible. Complex electrodes
have been devised by Bourguignon for 
stimulation through the human skin. The 
rheobase for the cut sialic of the frog is 0.2
to 0.3 volt, and the chronaxy is 0.3 to 0.4
thousandths of a second; in the load the chronaxie 
is less. Lapique, in spite of criticism,
contends that skeletal muscle has the same


(123 of 250)


116.


chronaxy as its motor nerve (isochronism), and 
believes that the action current of the latter
excites the muscle directly without the inter-
mediation of any junctional substance (K. Lucas
B - substance).


Chronaxy varies widely in different nerves even 
in the same animal. In general it is least in 
rapidly contracting muscles supplied by large 
nerve fibres. Differences are also noticeable
in treated by various reagents, those 
which swell the myelin sheath, for instance, 
increase the rheobase and shorten the chronaxy.
In man, Bourguignon found that the extensors 
have a chronaxy of 0.1, while that in the flexors 
is 0.4 or more ….. one may state,
however, that cutting a nerve roughly doubles
the chronaxy it possesses in the intact state.

After section of motor nerve to a muscle,

indicates a slowly acting tissue, and it is found 
that on direct stimulation the muscle gives
the “worm-like” contraction. Further because
of the long chronaxie, the briefly acting faradic 
stimulus is no longer effective whilst
the longer acting galvanic current produces
a response. Hence the reaction of degenerate.

In (?) of the idea expressed on p. 110 that the 
thalamus may be concerned in dem. praecox we
find : - 


1) From introspection we find that there are two
types of thought, (a) the type well described by 
Henderson and Gillespie (Ref. 44) (p. 186) as 
“direct, aggressive, matter-of-fact” and the other 
type characterised by the intensity of a (?) which
is seen best, perhaps, when a great actor forces
us to weep copiously at the sloppiest sentimentality.
I, personally, have had much experience of the 
latter. It is characterised by the fact that the 
affect completely dominates the situation - the 
affect is overwhelming. This letter type of thought 
is, in my opinion, definitely the type that leads 
to den. Praecox. I have had so much experience 
of it that I am certain of it. The person, so to speak,
is lost in a haze of tumultuous emotions instead 
of doing away with them and getting on with the 
job. Shakespeare expresses the same 
idea well in King Lear (Ref. 45).


 “...In such a night                                                         
To shut me out! Pour on, I will endure.
In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!

Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,—
O! that way madness lies; let me shun that;
No more of that.”


At first he is practical and attempts to alter this 
environment in a straightforward, aggressive
manner. This fails and he suddenly bursts 
forth into a highly emotional complaint. But as 
he says - “That way madness lies.” He 
recognises the danger of such outbursts and expresses
it. As one might say, he keeps a stiff upper 
lip again.


This part seems clear although, of course,
difficult to prove objectively.


2) Now such thinking seems to me to be 
very similar to the sensations of the thalamic 
syndrome of Dejerine and Roussy. Thus Price
(Ref. 4). p. 1310. “There is hemianesthesia,
often with a characteristic hyper-sensitivity to 
aggressive stimuli, such as tickling,
cold water, etc.” Note the tickling - I have
already mentioned this.


Steward, J. Purves (Ref. 25) p. 16, posits out that 
the thalamus is concerned with primitive sensations.
This may be compared with the return to dem.

(?) of the thalamus cause loss of emotional mobility
in the opposite side of the face in laughter or
crying. p 192 …. (in the thalamic 
syndrome) …. “and even emotional conditions of pleasure
or the reverse (e.g. those produced by music) may be 
accompanied by especially intense response in the 
abnormal half of the body. This thalamic overreaction 
is due, not to irritation of the thalamus, but to 
its release from normal cortical control.” He 
quotes Ref. 46.


Brian, W.R. (Ref. 14)*, goes fairly fully into the 
matter of the thalamus. p. 265 - description of 
thalamic syndrome. p. 267 - scraping, roughness, 
vibration, tickling - all are overreacted to and are 
said to be very unpleasant. All four tend to be 
described as “horribly painful.” (Compare here 
my own dislike (now gone) of touching velvet,
silk etc. also the common complaint of 
neurotics that they have a “very sensitive skin”
for shaving. Compare the neurotic type of 
reaction to the dentist’s drill - a typical 
thalamic reaction to vibration. Tickling I have 
referred to. Neurotics in general are nearly

always characterised by their inability to deal with 
painful or unpleasant stimuli. Compare also the 
neurotics inability to stand pain with the calm 
self control of the “normal” person - the 
latter is obviously able to inhibit the thalamic

is “pleasant warmth” - 38-40 degrees C. 


p. 268. Affected half of body is overreactive
also to emotions - more amorous on 
affected side and so on. Affected side seems to 
the patient to be more artistic. 


(Note, this last supports the idea that 
emotions and sensations are really homologous). 


(Note also the “artistic” observation. It is well known 
that the average “artistic” person is a candidate 
for D.P.) 


p. 272 - “The thalamus is the centre for the conscious
appreciation of the affective.” “Head believes
that the special features of the thalamic syndrome 
are “release phenomena”. He maintains that the 
activities of the thalamus are normally subjected 
to the higher control of the cortex. 


“Interference with these impulses abolishes this


(130 of 250)


123.


higher control, with the result that the thalamus, is 
free to exert its affective functions in a primitive
and haphazard manner.”


p. 273. Thalamic sensation is affective whereas 
cortical sensation is discriminative and intellectual.


Now compare the above with the note on 
Obsessive states in p.74 and 75 and 76 N. There we noted that
there are two types of resemblance - “sensory”, and 
“affect” - these now correspond, obviously, I think,
with cortical and thalamic resemblance. In dreams,
the thalamic type is exclusively present. In the obsessive
States, the patient is therefore reacting to his 
surroundings, not as his cortex dictates, but as 
his thalamus dictates - the thalamus is overruling 
the cortex, or, in other words, the cortex has failed 
to control or inhibit the thalamus.


With regard to the third type of resemblance
mentioned on p. 76. N; on second thoughts this seems 
to me to be an example of “affect” resemblance,
for the things are only associated or substituted when 
there is a strong “affect” resemblance or association.


The thalamus therefore controls behavior and is 
itself determined, not by the discriminative aspect 
of the situation, but purely by its present


(131 of 250)


124.


sensory or “affect” content. If the situation is 
pleasant it will perpetuate it, if the situation is 
unpleasant it will avoid it. Self control for the 
sake of future pleasure is unknown. The animal 
lives in the present and is guided exclusively 
by the present. This, of course, is well known 
to represent a childish, primitive, instinctive or 
reflex type of behavior, or, as Jung would call
It - “autistic” thought and behavior.


Blushing, incidentally, probably represents a 
thalamic reaction which is inhibited later by 
the adult activities of the cortex.


Note, re the three sensory levels of the three
dimensions of space, that since the thalamus is 
merely concerned with the affective nature of 
stimuli, the knowledge of three dimensions
must be a result of cortical activity for it is 
essentially an intellectual concept. This rather 
shatters the idea, since in a thalamic animal, since 
there are two sensory levels, it should have 
knowledge of two dimensions in space, whereas
it probably has none. One must either look
elsewhere therefore or admit that it really
exists.


(132 of 250)


125.


 If D.P. consists of a “muddle” between the 
cortex and thalamus, there should also exist 
examples of disorders due to a muddle between 
thalamus and spinal cord reflexes. What would
these be? There are a large some of possibles 
but none seem probables.


Possibles are Myoclonus, Anxiety neurosis due
to coitus interruptus, chorea, Huntington’s chorea, 
athetosis,  Ties, Myotonia and Amyonlonia congenita, 
Myasthenia gravis, Asthma, Exophthalmic goiter,
perhaps some parts of hysteria. This needs 
further consideration.

p. 606. A patient had his leg amputated and 
developed, mentally, a phantom limb in which 
he felt posture and movement. He then decoupled 
a cerebral lesion which deprived him of his 
sense of posture and movement on that side of the 
body - the phantom leg at once disappeared.


He postulates also another schema for localisation.


“Anything which participates in the conscious 
Movement of our bodies [walking stick, spoon, etc]

part of these schemata; a woman’s power of 
localisation may extend to the feather in her hat.”

He enunciates laws : -


“(1) the chronaxie classes the muscles and their nerves
in functional groups - muscles which, in 
the same region, are synergies for the
same movement have the same chronaxie.


2. Muscles which displace the segments of the 
limb or trunk forwards have a smaller 
chronaxie than the muscles which pull 
them back. In the face, the muscles 
which lower the skin have a smaller
chronaxie than those which lift it. The 
relation of the chronaxies of opposing muscles 
Is ½ to ⅓ except in the “cuisse” where it 
Is higher.


3. For the same function, those muscles
proximal have a smaller chronaxie than 
those more distal.


4. Chronaxie divides the posterior muscles
or muscle bundles into two 
groups - a) the antagonists of the muscles 
in front; these have a larger chronaxie 
than those in front -- b) those which 
are synergic to those in front; these muscle
bundles or muscles have the same chronaxie


(136 of 250)

sets with different chronaxies have different motor

In each region sensation chronaxie is equal
to the chronaxie of the muscles underlying (his
italics), in such a manner, that it is the function
of the muscles which determines the distribution
of the chronaxies, sensory and motor. We return 
therefore always to the same general law : -


Chronaxie has a functional distribution. 
p. 538. The “palm-chin” reflex of Marinescu
and Radovici consists in pricking the thenar eminence

chin follows. He has shown that all the

Chronaxie. In reflexes, one always finds that 
the sensory nerve, motor nerve, and muscle

p. 541. Has longest chronaxie for a nerve of the human body

be much concerned with the autonomic system. 
It shows heterochrony, for its action determines 
reflexly the action of muscles with a chronaxy 
about 1/100 of its time. Lapricque has shown that 
in the animals the sympathetic system functions 
heterochronally, whereas the cerebro spinal system functions
isochronally. 


Chronaxy in infants. New born child has all 
chronaxies bigger than that of adult. A reversal 
of order seems those with longest become 
shortest and vice versa. p. 542, By 15-20 months

are quicker and reach adult values in 2-3 months.


p. 543. The infant therefore shows heterochronaxie 
between the nerves and the motor point of the muscle,
the infantile extensor Babinski fits in with 
the reversed chronaxy.


He says, re the anatomical theory of the 
C.N.S. : - “depuis (?), les auteurs classiques 
ont cherché à établir un rapport entre l’etat
anatomique des nerfs et des muscles et les 
réactions électriques. Ce point de vue doit être 
radicalement abandonné. L'excitabilité, aussi 
bien que la forme de la contraction, sont des 
propriétés exclusivement physiologiques. Il me 
faut donc tirer des réactions électriques que des 
conclusions physiologique. Ce n’est que 
secondairement,..., que l’on pourra rerouter 
de la physiologie pathologique à l’anatomie 
pathologique.” He speaks of the new view point 
as physiology versus anatomy; I call it function
versus structure. It is the same idea. 


p. 546. In Thouseau’s (?), the myopathies, and degeneration 
after lower motor neurone lesion, the chronaxy of 
the muscle may go up to 200-300 times its normal.


“Pathological changes in the muscles makes the 


(139 of 250)


132.


normal differences between muscle-chronaxies disappear.”


“In the beginning one may sometimes observe a 
diminution of the chronaxy. 


p. 547. A normal muscle is homogenous and has only one 
chronaxy value. When there are two actions and two 
motor points, each bundle in itself is homogenous. 
In pathological changes the uniformity disappears and the 
(?) develop different chronaxies. p. 548. In 
regeneration often suturing the nerve, the chronaxy of 
the muscular falls steadily to normal. Although the
chronaxy falls, there is, of course, no sign of return 
of voluntary movement. (This needs some explanation 
!). p. 551. In pyramidal lesions : -


Upper limit relations of the chronaxies of muscles of upper 
limit remain the same. In lower limit the extensors 
of the big toe lengthen in chronaxy and flexors shorten.
This condition is also seen in the infant before 
the pyramidal tract functions and is seen in animals.
All have extensor response - giving strong evidence 
of the sensory motor isochronism in reflexes. See Rudolf,
G. de M, for plantar reflext in animals. (Ref. 48.).
There is therefore a regression to the infantile condition.


p. 553. This is an example of his concept of “repercussions,”


* “All lesion’s of a neuron may have


(140 of 250)


133. 


a repercussion on the chronaxy of the nerves with 
which they are functionally associated.”


p. 555. A poison (lead, arsenic, alcohol etc) seems 
to attack particularly systems with the same 
chronaxy, i.e. p. 533 : - Chronaxies - extensors
of wrist and fingers 0.44 - 0.72 (?), supinator
longus 0.08 - 0.16 (?). p. 556. Compression of 
Right arm - crhonaxy of muscle falls until the 
band is released, then chronaxy shoots up 10-15 times 
Normal; ten minutes later is back to normal.
After cold, chonraxy behaves in same way
repercussion occurs, for other muscles not concerned 
show an alteration (direction varies).

(Ref 49) a transitory extensor Babinski response in dem. praecox,

“Reflex action is thus akin to resonance.” “Chronaxy 
renders possible what may be called a physiological
resonance.” “The resonance and variation 
of rhythms offer almost infinite possibilities of 
co-ordination with a limited structural linkage.”
“As far as we can judge, therefore, the peripheral nerve
is within limits indifferent to the (?) of intensity 
and duration and the stimulus. In other words, at
that elementary sensory level from which we derive
the new material of consciousness, time and space, are 
within limits, indistinguishable…. it means,
however, that all vital activity, including consciousness,
is essentially four dimensional….chronaxy 
foreshadows a four dimensional philosophy of the

Note on dem. Praecox. One of the important things 
to notice is that practically all people either 
become normal by 30 years or D.P. There is no 
half way line. It is as if they walk on a 
line and then overbalance to one side or the other.
There is, as far as I know, no theory which 
adequately explains this. It has occurred to me 
that most D.P.s start off with plenty of premonitory.

symptoms, especially compulsions and obsessions. These
will be resisted at first as being incompatible with 
the rest of the mind. Speaking psychologically - 
when the person at last decides to try out and do 
or say one of the silly things he thinks of, he will
find that it is not as bad as he thought it 
was - it is accompanied by a relief of tension,
by pleasure, and he finds that it is not accompanied 
by any sense of “pain” except perhaps by a
unique sense of doing what he ought not to do.
But that is lost in the pleasures of the moment.
It may be compared exactly to the youth who starts
masturbation; at first he struggles; he may 
even start it, in which case he remains
Permanently continent. But once he tries it, he 
finds that the consequences are not as bad as he 
thought it would be and then down he slides and 
becomes a chronic masturbator with a vague 
feeling at the back of his mind that he is not 
doing right; a feeling which is continuously 
overwhelmed (one cannot say “swamped”!) by the 
pleasures of the moment -- pleasures which he no 
longer fears. This type of mechanism would 
explain well why the cases fall sharply into two

groups - D.P. and normal. Should the 
person struggle against his compulsions or obsessions 
until his mind gives way, the principle is not 
altered as the guiding force moves from 
the “free will” to the unconscious dynamic forces 
and these two are, of course, really identical.

Note on adaptation and inhibitions.


The body tends always to the satisfaction of 
its wants, it has a stream of “excitation” pouring 
forth to find satisfaction. Now in its adaptation,
it does so by developing more inhibitions, i.e. the
person who wants to track a policeman down 
must inhibit this and behave otherwise; the person
who wants to lie abed till 10 must inhibit this 
impulse and get up and so on. The libido is constant,
and we may put on record at once a postulate of the 
constancy of the libido. On the other hand 
inhibitions are not constant but pile up and up in 
the effort to adaptation; we may therefore propose
the postulate of adaptation by inhibition.


Furthermore the inhibitions are not piled on 
unnecessarily, they are only developed when 
necessary, therefore we may add the postulate


(144 of 250)


157.


of minimal inhibition.


We here have a clearer view of the situation.
As an example we may compare it to mercury 
flowing down a tray, being kept to a certain
path by walls being erected at intervals which 
direct the mercury along an appropriate path.
The downward tendency of the mercury from the 
gravitational pull may be compared to the 
forward drive of the libido, and the walls 
erected correspond to the inhibitions developed 
to direct it along its path.

Extract from Head (Ref 47.) (?) from 
p. 126. N.


P. 750. When the cortex is removed from action
the patient largely loses his power of projection,
i.e. he knows that he is being hurt, or touched 
by warmth, but he cannot build up a

is, psychologically, a projection.

Note on cortical function. I have just been reading 
Lashley (Ref 53). I can only say that I agree
(145 of 250)


138.


Thoroughly. He first rejects completely the old “path”
theory, ridiculing particularly the idea that memory consists
of the reaping of old tracks or paths. He points out
that there is no evidence for the theory that the 
passage of an impulse lowers synaptic resistance.
He mentions my old fact against it, that 
all parts of the visual cortex are equivalent for 
recognising an object, whether that particular bunch 
Has been stimulated before or not - it is the 
pattern which wants, not the receptors stimulated.
Re visual cortex he says (p. 9) “We find 
then at the point of projection on the cortex a 
variable pattern shifting over a fixed anatomical 
substratum.” On localisation he says p. 14 “the 
evidence on localisation suggests that where the 
relations of stimuli in space are of importance 
to behavior, there emits in the cortex a spacial
distribution of points corresponding to the sensory 
Surfaces, but that for all other functions a 
similar special arrangement is lacking. In terms 
Of the reflex theory such as spacial arrangement 
has little meaning, but in terms of the 
hypothesis to which I am leading, it is of 
prime importance.” The spatial arrangement


(146 of 250)


139. 


is shown, of course, most clearly in the visual 
cortex. 


Apropos of cortical injury in man he says (p. 17), 
“A review of symptoms suggests that no logically 
derived element of behavior can be shown to 
have a definite localisation; no single sensation,
memory, or skilled movement is destroyed alone by any lesion.”


He points out (p. 19) that in injuries of the cortex
there is never a (?) afterwards, merely a 
reduction in capacity. The cortex, after an injury,
promptly readjusts itself, but in virtue of its 
lowered mass, at a lower level. “Such 
phenomena suggest that the nervous system is 
capable of a self-regulation which gives a coherent 
logical character to its functioning, no matter 
how its anatomical constituents may be  
disturbed.”


He points out the many resemblances between 
development of the functions of the cortex. This is 
certainly true.


He gives a reference to Lapicque on chronaxy 
Switching (Ref 54).


p. 21 “The nervous unit of organization in behavior


(147 of 250)


140. 


is not the reflex arc, but the mechanism, whatever
be its nature, by which a reaction to a ratio of 
excitations is brought about.” 


All this leads very clearly on to my idea, so 
clearly that it can scarcely be called mine.
My idea might be called the “ripple” theory of 
cortical function. If one taps a large
sheet of water at one point one obtains a 
ripple, progressing as a series of waves over the 
Water, of circular form. Now tap it at another 
point, an exactly similar pattern is produced.
Touch it all two points - a pattern of 
interference is produced, touch it at another 
two points, again exactly the same pattern is 
formed. And my idea is that this is what 
happens in the cortex. That each stimulus 
or bundle of stimuli produces a pattern which 
is not static but dynamic, and spreads and radiates
and reflects and is modified by other patterns and 
So on.


In this connection note: - 


1) It is explains the equivalence of visual 
magic of the same object in different positions.
It explains Lashby’s point on p. 138. Obviously one must 
start with the night pattern.


(148 of 250)


2) Pavlov has shown that (?) and
concentration occur.


3) In the conditioned reflexes, for the auditory
Stimulus to get to the salivary gland, it 
Must spread all over the cortex.


4) It, of course, avoids the old “path” idea.


5) If this is so, and if the C.N.S. has the 
same basic principles throughout, then reflexes 
must work on this plan. This may supply the 
Experimental facts to work out the details.


6) Since there will obviously be a colossal
number of degrees of freedom to deal with, the 
question will probably have to be dealt with 
statistically eventually.


7) It gives me an idea of how a train of 
reactions such as walking may be repeated
over and over again idefinitely.

Note on dem. praecox, When a person is up against
(?), the normal method of adaptation, as given by 
the principle of “adaptation by inhibition”, is to develop 
more and more differentiation in his inhibitions, i.e. to 
complicate internally until it fits the complications
externally. When one observes early D.P. one notices


(149 of 250)


142. 


how this complication goes on and on until it gets so 
complicated that the whole thing becomes unintelligible.
Cf. the D.P. who said to me - “If I owed you money,
then I should be in charge of you.” And then added 
in explanation “Debtor to = Dr. to”. Now if he had 
actually owed me money, he might easily have 
said “I am in charge of you to make you well,”
and this would have been accounted to him as a 
delusion. It seems therefore that in D.P.
the normal process of complication or differentiation 
has sum (?) and instead of leading to a highly 
intimate contact with reality, has merely lead 
to a complicated tangle. The fundamental point,
I think, is that in all processes, mental or otherwise,
where efficiency is achieved by complication, it is 
most essential all the time that the fundamental
or primitive necessities be kept in view. To give 
an example, one might decide to make one’s 
car more efficient, so one adds this gadget and 
that and keeps adding bits and pieces : -- and then 
one finds that the car is just too heavy to move. 
In any process such as this, the fundamentals 
must be continuously kept in mind, and this is 
where the D.P. fails. He keeps adjusting to details 


(150 of 250)


143.


and missing the fundamentals (the primitive 
instincts). Naturally, as this starts, so the 
adaptation to reality becomes more and more 
difficult. He has started on the wrong lines 
and the further he goes the worse he gets. Once 
it starts, this process will therefore increase
with increasing velocity (an auto(?)
reaction) until it finished -- in dementia.
This would explain why they all or none 
law applies to D.P., i.e. there are no ⅓ D.P.s.

of the C.N.S. The path in the nerve was known to be 
fixed and continuous and it was imagined, of course,
that the path in the spinal cord was also fixed.


In 1822 Bell developed his idea of a “nervous 
circle (Ref 58) and in 1850 Marshall Hall (Ref 59) first 
used the term reflex arc. The introduction of 
the discoveries of the multicellular nature of the 
spinal cord did little to disturb the idea of a 
fixed path - a chain of cells was postulated instead 
of a single nerve fibre.


p. 169. Lewes was the first to attack this idea.
He (Ref 60) attacked the evidence for the existence 
of the anatomical structures which are assumed 
to underlie reflex action. He points out that it 
is a case of an “imaginary physiology” resting on 
an “imaginary anatomy.” To quote Lewes - “the 
sensory nerve is not seen to enter the spinal
cord at one point, and pass over to a corresponding 
point of exit; it is seen to enter the gray 
substance, which is continuous throughout the 
spinal cord; it is there lost to view, its 
course being untraceable.” (My italics).


It is the physiology of the C.N.S. which controls

the reflexes, not its macroscopic and microscopic
anatomy. 


p. 194. Lander Bruton has offered a wave theory
with inhibition explained as a physical interference.
(Ref 61) Von Frey (Ref 62) stimulated both 
vasoconstriction and vasodilation fibres to the 
submaxillary gland, and found that the vaso-c.
obtained victory during the stimulation and that 
the vasodilators made their effects felt later.
Bayliss (Ref 41) thought this incompatible with the 
wave theory (but there seem to be many 
fallacies both ways.)


Howell (Ref 63) has collected the facts on 
inhibition and its nature.


p. 253. Fearing concludes a chapter with a warning -
“The terms “reflex”, “involuntary”, “voluntary” and 
“automatic” are more than classificatory designations;
they have come to carry a burden of implications, 
philosophical, physiological and psychological as 
 to the nature of nervous function. It is essential 
that they be used with caution, and that the hypothetical 
implications which they have acquired during 
the 17th and 18th centuries be regarded as 
provisional only.” (His italics)

p. 288. He quite correctly points out the misleading
nature of the ordinary tent book diagram. “A source
of confusion has been that physiology and especially
psychology have taken for granted a simplicity
of function simply because of an assumed 
simplicity of structure. The reflex arc is easily 
diagrammed in the tent book; such a diagram
……. is misleading even in connection with the
simpler animal responses, and is positively inapplicable 
to the more complex organic responses.”


p. 308. Marina (Ref 64) crossed the internal and external
 recti muscles of the eye on one side in apes and found that,
as soon as the wounds were healed, the eyes 
moved normally. From this and from many other 
similar results he concluded that the conduction
pathways have no predestined 
function and he demands a new foundation for 
the physiology of the brain.

Note on the influence of drugs. One of the things a theory of 
C.N.S function must include is an account of how 
Drugs, hormone s etc may influence the mind, and 
behavior. Some of these act in a very simple manner


(154 of 250)


147. 


as when strychnine causes simple convulsions (simple 
psychologically), but others act in a most complicated
way - (?) on the sex impulse, testicular hormones
on the same thing, menstruation in women, hashish,
alcohol, bromide. These must have a place in the
theory. Since they act almost certainly on the individual 
nerve cells, it means that we must look for the 
explanation at this level. The above may also give us
a clue as to the nature of the functions.

To continue the analogy of the financial system and cerebration. 
Now it is important to notice that the whole system 
has grown up form one basic principle -- “that man 
wants possessions;” and in its integrated form D still 
works to achieve this same end. Similarly the brain 
the unicellular animal wants food, life and reproduction, 
and the whole adult reactions are still directed to this 
end. In the F.S. each individual still works in his
marrow groove to achieve just the same ends as did 
his savage forefather, it is merely the complexity
of the whole which has altered. Similarly in the
brain; it means that the cells of the brain must still,
in their narrow grooves, be attempting to do as the 


(155 of 250)


148.


same as did their face living ancestors. Nowadays 
however, they have to work for the same ends in 
a much narrower groove, just like the city bank
clerk who is striving to obtain a maximum of 
possessions, but is driven, by force of (?),
to achieve his end by certain devious routes (i.e.
he has to work for cash, and then buy possessions with 
his cash) and the intelligence of the whole thing dies 
in the development of the deviousness of the routes 
until at length he is taking part in a scheme
far greater than he can even visualise. Therefore 
it seems probable that the brain cells will today 
still be behaving according to the same principles 
as actuated them when free, i.e. the search for 
food, the avoidance of pain, and so on. Therefore we 
must investigate the simple (?) of protoplasm 
and see if we can get on from this as starting 
point. This idea, that each unit, as it 
integrates with others, still continues to seek 
the same things as before, we will call the postulate 
of the constancy of cell function. It is possible,
but not certain. One of the differences is that 
so far I have only found one system with which 
to compare the brain, namely the financial system.

Extracts from Rogers (Ref 67). 


p. 452. Points out there are two types of C.N.S. in the animal 
kingdom - nerve nets, and synaptic nervous systems. The 
first (with its complete union of cells) is more primitive 
and soon gives way to the synaptic system, being represented
in the vertebrates only by the vascular and intestinal
plexuses. A nerve net can only conduct generally
and in all directions. Strychnine, (which is supposed 
to act on the synapse [but prof. on chronaxy (?)]) has 
no effect on Hydra (Moore, Ref 68)


p. 459. Ramon y Cajal has figured a Purkinje 
cell , anatomising with another fibres, every (?)
of the one being followed by the other. Now why on 
earth should the 30 000 synapses of each cell 
join all together so that in the end only two cells
are joined. i.e. why not the two cells join by 
1, and not by 10 000, synapses? (There is something 
very definite here; there is a message here if I can 
decipher it.)


p. 463. Miller’s law of specific nerve energies is 
that, stimulate the optic nerve as you will and you 
get a sensation of light; similarly the auditory 
nerve, no matter how it is stimulated, gives a 
sensation of sound.

which divide into two axons, which supply the

excitatory and one inhibitory. -- an example of 
peripheral inhibition. In the vertebrates, this type 
of inhibition is restricted to the nerves of involuntary 
muscle.

Extracts from Herrick (Ref. 70).


p. 9 He introduces the concepts of physiological gradients 
and dominance.


p. 46. He discusses an idea that I have had, namely 
the possible principle of entropy as a dominating guide to 
biology. It has been fulled discussed by Johnstone 
(Ref 71) but seems to lead nowhere.


It seems to me that one might make the general
assumption that all protoplasm reacts exclusively to 
stimuli which alters the essential membranes of the 
cell. The adaptations of protoplasm, therefore, are 
adaptations to protect the essential, intracellular
membranes. 


p. 65. He introduces the concept of polarity (biological) i.e. 
in the amoeba there is already developed a surface-interior 
polarity. Later, of course, antero-posterior polarity develops.


p. 72. It has been abundantly shown, especially by 
Child, C.M, that the sensitiveness to brains and injuries 
increases with the physiological activity 
of the part. i.e. in KCN or Vorheilla and Stenton 
death and disintegration starts at the mouth end and 
progresses backwards. This agrees with the well 
known law of (?) (particularly alcohol) on 
the C.N.S., that they attack the highest centres first.

p. 75. Sensory receptors are at the top of the physiological 
gradient in the nervous system and hence show 
“dominance” over the rest. Contractible tissues are 
at the bottom of the gradient.


p. 104. Apparently the synaptic nervous system has grown out 
of the syncytial type. Chromodoris, a marine 
mollusc has a nervous system composed partly 
of one and partly of the other type (Crozier and Arzay 
Ref 72.) 


p. 111. There are several theories of the development 
of the C.N.S. 1) by the primary axial gradients in the 
growing field (Child Ref 73), 2) by the dynamic 
influence of excitations traversing neighboring 
nervous pathways which are already functionally
active (stimulogenous fibrillation of Bok (Ref 74))
3) By bioelectric currents (Ingram Ref 75), 4)
by Neurobiotaxis (Kappers Ref 76) 


p. 113. Tashiro (Ref 77) has shown that the neuron has a 
Physiological gradient; metabolism being most intense 
at the receptive end and diminishing steadily to the 
emissive end.

p. 140 Heck (Ref 79) has shown that earthworms can memorise

anterior segments does not destroy the memory.
Obviously memory is diffused at least fairly 
equally throughout the whole C.N.S.


p. 136. It has been shown that the action of KCN is a 
reliable indication of high metabolism and that this 
relationship is exact throughout the whole range.


p. 151. Turner (Ref 80) has shown that insects certainly can 
learn, and the apparently finity of their reactions is more apparent

along them but still would not touch them. 


p. 256. He points out that neurons have two functions demanding
Attention; one might describe them as personal and 
social, i.e. firstly each cell must attend to its 
own metabolic needs, its own personal 
hygiene; secondly, it must play its parts in the 
layer scheme as a unit in the C.N.S. (Now the 
neuron is supposed to be completely surrounded 
by a membrane for the second purpose. Does

all the diffusion of metabolic products take place 
through this probably highly specialised membrane,
especially through the myelin sheath? The fact 
Of Wallerian degeneration suggest that it does not.
Then where does the neuron get its nourishment, and 
where is the break in the membrane? There are
thus two possibilities - 1) that the neuron obtains
its nourishment, (?), and gets rid of waste
products through the “conducting” membrane,
or 2) that there is one part of the cell laid 
bare for assimilation and excretion, and that the 
rest is fed from this, and is walled in by its
conducting membrane. Tashino’s CO2 may have
come from the neurilemmal sheath. Of course,
if he was dealing with peripheral nerve, and it 
definitely gave off extra CO2 on stimulation,
then one may definitely plump for 1. I must 
look this up. Another method would be to test
susceptibility to diffusible drugs such as KCN, 
for the peripheral nerve, if walled off by the 
myelin sheath and membrane, should be more 
or less immune.)


p. 258. “The neurons absorb nutrient materials from 
the surrounding fluids and give up wastes to them

chiefly through their cell bodies and their dendrites;
the axons probably participate in this function but 
little.” “The amount of metabolism of the 
gray matter is much greater per unit weight 
than in the white matter, as is shown by the 
richer blood supply and in other ways.” The 
vascularity has been measured quantitatively by 
Craigie (Refs 82 and 83), who finds that sensory 
centres are better supplied than are motor 
centres.

It seemed to me today that a fat man, having a 
thicker “dermis” must, other things being equal, 
have a gentler surface-interior gradient than a 
thin man. Has this anything to do with the known 
activity of the thin and the lethargy of the fat. Does 
a fat man have flat cerebral gradients in 
the cortex and a thin man steep gradients?
The gradient would of course be given by 
dM/ds where M is the height of “metabolism,”
and s the distance.

How may the unconscious be possibly explained on 
a neural mechanism? By “unconscious”  I mean 
the facts of repression, sublimation, complex 
formulation etc. An idea that occurs to me is 
that if a particular group of neurons gets into a 
state where it just will not resonate to a 
particular pattern, then that is obviously like 
repression. And one can imagine that if the 
pattern is sufficiently distorted, it may then 
get through (cf. symbolism in dreams).
Repression and inhibition, therefore, mean that 
the nerve cells just will not act according to 
that particular pattern - the whole thing 
jams, shall we say, when a particular group
of stimuli is supplied.

Extracts from Lapicque. (Ref 54).


He points out the hopelessness of trying to describe the 
reflex and its properties by means of a diagram on paper 
of the anatomical connections. (Herrick, Ref 70, contains
some good examples of this type of explanation).


Bremer and Rylant in 1924 and 1925 showed that 
strychnine tends to equalise all the chronaxies in the 
CNS. 


Two sorts of chronaxy values exist. “Mme. Lapricque 
(1923) noticed that the motor nerve of the gastrocnemius,
studied in an injured or decerebrate frog [I presume he 
means “without cerebral hemispheres”] shows a variable 
chronaxy, as a rule smaller than the value characteristic 
for the leg severed from the body. Severing the 
nerve from the spinal cord, a transaction of the bulb, that 
is, removing the control of the encephalon, reestablished 
the usual chronaxy at a constant value. This proved 
that the (?) has the power of modifying the 
chronaxies of peripheral motor nerves. In contradistinction 
to the “constitutional” chronaxy we will call this
modified value the “subordinate” chronaxy.


Chronaxy of cortical motor centres is essentially
variable. M. and Mme. Chauchard have shown
this. Anaesthetics considerably increase cortical 


(165 of 250)


158. 


chronaxy in doses insufficient appreciably to modify 
that of the peripheral nerves.


Rizzolo, in 1927, could modify the chronaxy 
of the motor cortex by the application of heat or cold 
or previous electrical excitation to the part of the body
connected with the motor area under investigation.


Cardor, H, in 1971 showed that the activity 
of the vagus and thyroid affected the chronaxy of the 
motor cortex.


It is known that a spinal reflex 
may be reversed by a change of posture. I.e.
if the leg is in full flexion, then application 
of a painful stimulus may cause extension instead 
of the usual flexion reflex. “We have found 
that the chronaxy of the motor neurons of each 
muscle, in a decerebrate animal, undergoes large 
variations according to the posture of the limb.”


“Our theory easily solves the problem of 
the nature of inhibition.” It is, that if the 
chronaxy is altered to 2:1 with the next 
neuron, the impulse will not pass.

Freud’s statement about dreams, that apparently
the whole of the mind goes into each dream
intrigues me since it is a general law. It has 
just occurred to me that this may be explained 
thus: - if the dream consists of “ripples” wandering 
over the cortex, they will be modified at every 
point according to the past history of the neuron at 
that point. If the manifest content is the result 
of the integration of all this mass of “ripples,” it 
means that the dream will be modified at every 
point according to the past history of the neuron at 
that point. If the manifest content is the result 
of the integration of all this mass of “ripples,” it 
means that the dream will be modified at every 
point in its production by the past history of every 
cell. Hence the conclusion that the dream will
be modified by, or will contain elements of, the whole
of the previous life of the individual.


It seems to be appearing that the whole of the 
cortex always acts in every thought and action.


From the previous we may draw the following 
(provision) conclusions, which we will state as 
postulates : - 


1. The passage of an impulse always affects the 
cell permanently. The postulate of permanent
cellular modification. I have called it modification 
to indicate its obvious connection with the postulate 
of (psychological) modification; but in referring

Instinct and cerebration. Now given a set of
neurons connected into a net with receptors and effectors,
and given certain function rules, the whole will act 
in a uniform and rational manner. So far so good.
But the problem is, where are we going to insert

will lead to nest building, in another to the 
flight reaction, in another to the development of the 
male sexual reactions and in another of the female 
sex reactions etc. (?) the nerve net above, 
it must contain the potentialities of all the above,
since the same type of nerve net subserves them
all. Where do the differences lie? Does it lie 
in anatomical details, gross or microscopic, or in
the function rules of the neuron, or on the make up 
of the receptors, or where? There is one clue that 
helps, namely that these varieties are particularly
apt to be disturbed or altered by hormones. It 
makes one think therefore that almost certainly the 
differences must lie at a rather primitive, chemical
